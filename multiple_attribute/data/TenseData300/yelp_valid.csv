absolutely the best carne i 've ever had and the service is great also .
it was a slap in the face on so many levels .
"he is very pleasant , caring and knowledgable ."
he came back the next day and treated for big headed ants .
i expect much more out of a premier club in scottsdale .
tomato sauce + chicken broth does not = tomato soup !

the bread and salads are also tasty !
"they claim excuse after excuse , not to fix there cheap quality lenses !"

the atmosphere is more upscale and relaxing but very nice .
prices are very reasonable and everyone is very friendly .
prices are good and i love the fuel points .

nicole was a great server .
"he is a great employee , hard working unlike most people ."
i thought it was good .
the people at the counter are nice and very efficient .

$ _num_ got me pretty much the run of the town .
our waiter ( did n't catch his name ) was super attentive & nice !

i truly adore these ladies and highly recommend them .
i purchased a groupon for a mani pedi and basically just got a mani .
"finished my steak , still no cheese ."
"though it 's old , it 's clean ."
made my wife so mad that she left and went to another place .
this gem of a breakfast joint is tucked into the chandler air park .
my favorite thing is the salmon and sweet potato ravioli 's !
every bite was overwhelmingly unbearable .
"for now , there 's nothing to bring me back ."
thank you barry and crew so much for everything you guys do .
"this last order , we threw most of it away ."
"the grounds are not well kept , the residents just throw trash all over ."
the last time i went though the service was horrible .
they have great prices and amazing clearance racks !
experience was good .
their chicken dinner meal looked like sliced cafeteria chicken .

it 's the freshest chinese food i 've seen or had in ages !
this is a fun neighborhood bar .

let me begin by saying i was really looking forward to this place .
they treat you like royalty here .
every dish is tasty but the pistachio ice-cream is delicious .

fred tuned my piano today .
but the food just was not good .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
"did not go inside , but this looks great ( we parked outside ) ."
then i realized why people shut their doors !
the happy hour makes the pricing a little more reasonable .
what am i _num_ years old ?
"the decor was nice and simple , but contemporary ."
their selection is top notch .
restaurant is a small place tucked in a strip mall .
thank you thank you !
also their chili is usually watered down .
the hostess did n't even apologize .
i was there _num_ minutes and no one made a move to clean anything .

"sat at the bar , great selection of micro brews ."
amanda the service manager is so nice and they are super fast .
"went back with another couple sunday , and it was totally different ."
"all in all , i do n't really want to ever return ."
better than dunkin ( and i love theirs ) .
it was just as good as i remembered as a kid !
"so , we ended up getting the cilantro jalapeno hummus and some tzatziki ."
a quality facility that took excellent care of my dogs .
"i was in on february _num_ , _num_ ."
it sounded like fun but fell a little short of expectations .
i think the food is worth it .
it was huge for us two and just ended up taking the rest home .
garlic pizza was okay .
quality of food was so-so and service was slow .
i really liked this place .
the pork was fatty and more like pork soup .
the happy hour is great .
i asked for linguine & clam sauce and a fettuccine alfredo .
each time i used the restroom i never once saw people wash their hands .
and the food was marginal at best .
i really appreciate the wonderful service at brakes plus .
this restaurant offers something for everyone .
i am a huge fan of a deal !
the guacamole & chips were very good .

fantastic place to see a show as every seat is a great seat !

"such delicious and special little treats , and the dates are fantastic !"
had the coconut iced coffee which was delicious and huge .

"finally , after _num_ weeks i had to use the rv ."
"these people are loving and caring to animals , and respectful to their owners ."
"the meats were skimpy , salty and flavorless ."
the steaks were arguably one of the best i 've ever had .
it was clear that she knew that some guests had a problem .
"the persian ice cream was delicious , it smelled like roses ."
she was really friendly and nice .
"it 's burger king , not morton 's steak house ."
are you kidding me ?
there are a bunch of native american 's that frequent this establishment .
ok i had to go back and remove a star .
this is the place !
i was very disappointed .
"we left our phone number for nathan , the manager , to call us ."
frank and lupe 's is classic old town .
it was chips with fake cheese sauce .
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
then they are too big for the other fingers .
we 've gotten their food a few times now and it 's not bad .
i really enjoyed both but especially the roasted red pepper !
the border bowl is so delicious .
wish things would have worked out because it is a great concept .

we ate each morning at rita 's and they took great care of us .

it looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is .
the staff is friendly and helpful .
"anthony , our server , was very attentive but not hovering ."
we fell in love instantly !
"great service , cozy and does great work ."
nothing is worse than overcooked chicken .
she offered no apology and no compensation for my trouble .
you have to sit outside to get the best experience from this place .
simply put ... a great dive .
the concierge at our hotel recommended the tortilla factory but what a disappointment .
"if you 're paying more than $ _num_ per night , look elsewhere ."
tonight it was like eating cardboard .
the sausage tasted like fake meat and the pasta was over cooked and mushy .
one of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held .
the happy family was good as well .
service was great .
as good as it gets !
"that is a good thing , right ?"
i just want to thank them for all the great accomodations .
the food is good and the delivery is on point .
there drinks are extra sweet too like mexican pop .
the meat was tender and juicy .
"plus , we always have leftovers to enjoy during the rest of our trip ."
i mean i get it ... mistakes happen .
"we left there happy , full and so glad we had gone !"
i went in for a fill with gel polish on tuesday .
this was my second time at ra .
best guac i 've ever had .
"i wonder if they changed owners , but i want the old way back !"
"and , second , this place sucks ."
we loved being so close to the players .
i just do n't get it .
it 's built more for ambiance than food quality .
stay away unless you are a local who eats here all the time .
and she gave me _num_ more pairs .
the server was really nice and attentive and got our drinks and food order .
i am a fan !
i hate dealing with them .

stetson salad !
my husband had the banana nut cakes and also loved them .
the only thing edible was their cut oranges .
course is in terrible conditions .
"the televisions are over _num_ years old , tube televisions with horrible viewing ."
both my husbands and my eggs were not seasoned whatsoever .
she does an excellent job and is reasonably priced .
this coffee shop is unique and down right cute .
it was served on styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking .
the burros are mouthwatering and the chimichangas are big and juicy !
this is an excellent breakfast place .
the breakfast burritos are not good at all .
the enchiladas were not even rolled .
our air has n't been working for the past few weeks .
"the steak was extremely juicy , soft , and omg yummy !"
no one really ate their food .
this place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs .
she says i 've been rude since she told me about the coffee .
they have a wide variety of brands .
the waiters and waitresses are all very kind and welcoming .
"the service was pretty bad to , really slow ."
they tried pushing a $ _num_ car wash on me .
at this point i knew i was in trouble .
"however , that was n't the worst part ."
do not believe the positive reviews -- they are paid advertising .
walked around the store for _num_ minutes with no acknowledgement from the staff .
"all u could taste was corn tortilla , thick , and dry ."
"do n't bother with the salsa , it comes from a jar ."
that was enough for me to cancel my order and never return .
it 's like the restaurant does n't know what it wants to be .
"and if you are female , you better believe they will ."
service was great !
the ambience is well worth it .
i guess i 'll have to find another place to do my dry cleaning .
"luckily , the italian joint across the street is really pretty good !"
he helps me manage my back issues and keeps me healthy and active .
in general it feels small and is usually empty for a reason .
the best part is the homemade tortillas !
a shame because the dressing was pretty good .
this one kfc location is by far above and beyond the rest .
the furniture there is really cute !
this place was the best .
ok this place is horrible .
our meals have always been very good .
i had _num_ margaritas and could n't even draw a buzz .

it 's fantastic .
the people who work there are so so so so so rude .
dr. dan is the man !
he is a wonderful asset to the downtown !
( oh how i wish i would have read them now ! )
this is one of my favorite places for breakfast .
"if the food had been outstanding , maybe i 'd try again ."
he ate two bites and pushed it away .
great baked goods made from such a great staff that goes above expectations .

good was excellent and the chopped salad lived up to expectations .
researched for months and found the very best .

"i have a big heart , and there 's room enough for you both ."
i 've always had great service here too .
he saved the day .
best sashimi in the valley hands down !
this is really as good as it gets - consistently great quality .
service was slow .
"omg , i love this place !"
i agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible .
the entire experience was incredible .
and that is not normal we leave _num_ to _num_ % almost always .
customer service is not great either .
and they are all consistent in taste .
my advice if you go : try the mozzarella salad .
food is just ok not real mexican flavor as they advertise .
there was no offer to pay for cleaning .
the last time was so disappointing .
"if they toast your bun , consider yourself lucky ."
super b is the real deal .
"loved the pork appetizer , trout , and dr pepper ribs especially ."
i agree with everyone who says that the onions are way too salty .
plus the people are pretty laid back and friendly .
"cons -- ugh , where do i start ?"
the chips and salsa were hot and fresh .
thanks for always making me feel welcome when i stop by .
the service is amazing !
the employees are always welcoming with a big smile .

the community is quiet .
i had their chianti with dinner and thought it to be superb .
the fresh baked bread is soooo good .
we left full and happy !
they are awful .

the toast was a little soggy and bland .

this place has the true italian feel to it especially with the market inside .
i have been here quite a few times and always thoroughly enjoy everything .
"this is the best , most honest and great company ."
it is served with fresh cut french fries .
he does n't care .
it is simply the best pizza in town .
the food is good as well as the frosty beverages .

i will definitely be back when i 'm in town !
i hated living here !

kyoto is now one of my favorite restaurants .
the outside seating is very cool with waterfall and river features .
it was so bad we still had plenty left .
staff is well versed in product and always willing to go above and beyond .
the black light lights it up .
that smothered chimi is divine !
at that time i requested a little more gravy for my hashbrowns .
staff always greets you warmly .
"however , nowhere on the pass did it state any of these restrictions ."
lines & waiting - i did n't have to wait at all .
"also , my fillings ended up uneven ."
unfortunately the people running villa deli lost it a long time ago .
"more than that , though , is the great atmosphere !"

i went for lunch with my husband .
"this is first date , anniversary , birthday type spot ."
we stopped in here last night for dinner and were both pleasantly surprised .

"the most important thing , of course , is the food ."
i just need to start out by saying ... best happy hour ever !

best doughnut we have had in chandler .
i 'm so disappointed in this place .
plus it was nice to see her large playful dog in the background .
the mozzarella sub is absolutely amazing .
i do not recommend them to anyone .
the employee appeared to stop the swing before it hit the guy .

the brewery atmosphere is standard .
she liked the pickle the best though .
no way are we going to waste our time looking here .
i love being a part of this .
their prices are a bit high .
he 's a rarity among doctors these days .

no that was n't the case .
the price of the dinners simply does not justify the quality of the experience .

i 'm just asking for a little professionalism .
the rude sales girl turned her back and walked away .

my daughter was way to sick to have just an ear infection .

instructors keep the material fun .
everything i have tried here has always been very good .
but i have no idea how they can call these the best rib 's .

i ca n't say the ribs were anything spectacular .
the greek salad was delicious and generous in size for a moderate price .
the tuna tartare and calamari were also outstanding .
the service was top notch !
i ca n't believe i had to pay for this .

at this tire pros they really go above and beyond for their customers !
i got a half order and i was so full !
for an appetizer i would recommend the humus - it was amazing !
nothing like i asked for .

there is no where inside for people to sit while waiting for a table .
"however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed ."
all the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable .
the place is very low key and the music is great .
there were not that many people dining .

their prices are very fair as well .

"not to mention , he knew it was a friends birthday ."
i have been very happy with this company as a whole .
hands down the best green chili pork i 've ever had .
george is a most gracious host and is very proud of his restaurant .

i highly recommend this place and ca n't wait to go back !
she did n't deserve that good of a tip .
he gives them excellent care and they are always happy to see him .

"oh well , who cares ... right ?"
it 's got a good chorizo breakfast burrito .
we were seated with kyle and he was very friendly and attentive .
i love jamba juice .
their oranges are to die for and the staff are very friendly .
"neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin , too ."
good tournament is held every tuesday at _num_ .
the x ray tech is fantastic .
wish i would have .
it seemed like everything was just cooked too hot .
they really put effort into new years eve .
i 'm getting my breakfast smoothie !
they are very friendly and helpful .
i do not get it on any level .
worst chinese food i have ever had .
nothing special and the drinks are n't cheap .
they 've run off my business as well .
i was surprised and impressed !
the service was slow and the food did n't have any flavor .
the decor and ambiance are really what make the place .
the people are nice and they do a decent job !
"seats are comfortable , if not luxurious ."
$ _num_ later and i 'm still craving pho .
it 's a great place to take a break after shopping .
"the nachos here , were made with more gourmet ingredients ."
( or the bar ) your service is decent .
tried the angus deluxe as well as the grilled bbq chicken wrap .
the change in management is a disaster .
good thing we do n't have one where i live .
if you like beer this is the place for you .
a must have is the stetson salad ; i love this salad !
"seriously , really had a great time ."
place really sucks .
_num_ minutes later we were eating tacos i made at home .
thank you guys !
i love pop .
prices were very reasonable as well .
this woman makes the best damn bloody marys ( outside of a bar ) !
i love love love the food here .
i 've only gone here twice but i really love this ice cream parlor .
plus it 's right down the street from my house .
i had to spit out half of it because of such low quality .
the food was really well done .
is great and gives you a taste of everything .
the sauce did nothing for me .
"everything was cooked to perfection , beautifully plated , and tasted like a dream ."
we were sat right away and every staff member was extremely friendly and happy .
the food takes a bit but is delish !
the miso soup seems like its from a dry mix .
i moved from out of state and met some really good friends here .
this pharmacy seems to be quite inefficient .
one of our friends was told he had a fake id and is _num_ .
the outside area is great with the waterfall and all .
you guys were great !
the hummus is great .
and the fries are amazing with that seasoning on them !
i am a fan !
"i 'm thinking , you do n't recognize me ?"
received it luke warm .
sent back our bloody mary 's because they were watery and bland .
she lives right off the _num_ and bell i believe !
the pizza was very reminiscent of the midwest and made me think of home .
this place is golden !
the prices are excellent and they offer quite a few specials !
"thank you , nordstrom 's ."
he walked off .
i love this dealership !
wait staff did n't seem interested when taking our order .
"when we ordered , i asked for chips and salsa ."
ahhh love this place .
she had a too bad so sad attitude .
"in my opinion , that ruins a small intimate show ."
this place is perfect .
not busy for a s slow as it was .
we were very happy with raintree .
i popped in here and was able to get both things done very fast .
"then , i asked if one of the pieces i ordered were free ."
the pancakes are delicious and pretty much everything i ordered was amazing .
gammage itself however is not so amazing .
relatively small - _num_ rooms - which is nice .
gyro meat as good as it gets !
my bad for ordering something they did not stock .
the staff and service was very friendly and good .
the blueberry bread pudding is a must for dessert .
went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while .
this place is a terrible place to live !
"needless to say , it just sat there ."
they have contacted me this week to try to remedy this .
there last thursday and waited _num_ minutes with no waiter .
the scenery was spectacular !
it 's generic americanized asian food .
this is my favorite new mexican restaurant in arizona .
"i think it goes without saying , we wo n't be staying there again ."
look at my previous reviews of other dos and i am typically very fair .
the waiter at the spa pool on the other hand was a jerk .
"it was kind of awkward , actually ."
great lunch spot that we frequent quite a bit .
plus i still did n't get my refill .
everything was very expensive .
i had received a birthday gift certificate from firestone for a free oil change .
everything else was great .
called again on monday and they still have no results .
the staff was always very attentive and friendly .
highly recommend if you 're in the area .
it makes me sad .
the big a $ $ burger is $ _num_ and absolutely incredible .
had a great dinner tonight .
biscuits and gravy is the real deal .
the salsa was canned and the chips were bagged .
people there are rude and talk down to you .
"and i must say , i loved the place ."
the chips and salsa were very tasty as well .
immediately when we walked in and had a horrible feeling about this place .
"in all , we had a very good experience ."
this is my go-to place in my new neighborhood !
i guess that 's a good thing .
cowboy ciao was so good !
the prices were incredibly reasonable .
decor is bright and airy .
they were very friendly and informative .
fist clue should have been that the fish was in a perfect square !
"wow , i am in love with this place !"
this is that kind of place .
the drinks are pretty well priced .
"nothing to it , not prepared correctly and the chicken was stringy and dry ."
the little bar snacks they give you as well are great !
"she did an okay job with the cuticles , but nothing special ."
this place is huge and clean .
it smelled like fish tank water .
the manicure was terrible .
"these people are n't for the animals , they 're just after the money !"
the staff are so friendly and answered any questions we had .
"i loved the room , hospitality and location ."
i really appreciated the help and friendly tips .
tuesday rolls around and still no papers or update .
it is quiet and i always feel safe .
even the coffee was good .
"love zipps , it 's a scottsdale institution ."
scottsdale ( indian school ) kfc is horrible .
they really have the best wings .
our timing was perfect as it immediately began to crowd up .
the service was phenomenal and will definitely go back again and again !
the wait for the soup was _num_ min .
they have great food !
she seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time .
it is seriously my favorite wine bar in the us .
regular coffee goes just fine with their treats .
this used to be my favorite place to eat .
whoever they hired to do the remodel was awful .
i love this place !
service is very quick and friendly .
the price was outstanding service was even better .
room number two was n't made up or cleaned .
daily specials are usually great .
"scheduling was also seamless with clear instructions , etc ."
i did eat at top shelf twice within a week and a half .
we had a great meal .
this store is the best.
the fried pickles were nothing to write home about .
it also feels like a genuine english pub !
customer service is clearly a priority to everyone .
"first off let me say , i have been to many shows here ."
this facility is amazing !
"the band was wonderful , as well ."
loved this place !
"overall , love this place ."
their donuts are amazing and the staff is always very friendly !
looks like i 'm never coming back .
i absolutely loved it and ca n't wait to go back !
it was a small joint but had a pleasant atmosphere with a friendly staff .
i loved her joyful personality !
i would say for the price point that it was uninspired .
"long story short , the pizza is nasty and definitely not thin crust ."
these guys are great .
would have not given any stars at all but that was not an option !
the unlimited bread they give you with your meal is delicious .
we had ordered and the food came out very fast and everything tasted great .
waiter was obnoxious and became extremely annoying as the evening went on .
all he said was `` leave '' and walked away from us .
there did n't seem to be anyone in charge .
"it is loud music , loud people , over the top decor ."
i am not plus sized but i 'm also not a size _num_ .
and they said they would give me a $ _num_ gift card .
loved the wine selection and other grocery goodies !
even with premium tequila they are just not made very well .
"also , the salon is clean and beautiful ."
"the pizza , ribs and gooey butter cake are phenomenal ."
there 's just too many other good choices out there .
that makes no sense whatsoever .
i absolutely love love love sephora !
vegetables and house salad are always fresh and tasty !
the happy family is amazing and my dish of choice .
"staff is prompt , friendly and helpful ."
honestly i do n't get it .
such a shame as this place was right down the street for me .
this is one of the best emergency rooms i have ever been treated .
i just always feel comfortable in this down-to-earth office .
scottsdale stadium is a great place to catch a spring training game !
they were so flavorful and yummy !
it 's a go-to date night choice for my fiance and i .
"i highly recommend this salon and the wonderfully talented stylist , angel ."
this place was great !

it costs money to park and they do n't have many spaces .
"johnny , the manager , told me that he would issue a gift certificate ."
yeah i did n't really like this bar .
i love this great clips .
love love love love this place .
oh and it was really hard to find .
does n't matter how the food is .
she did n't charge me for coffee .
the fruit plate was incredibly fresh and their coffee was excellent too .
always delish !
yet all the negative reviews you read on yelp directly applied to our room .
the restaurant in general was not very clean .
"maybe this is explained somewhere on the site , but not clearly ."
the food is delicious and definitely way better than your average chinese delivery spot .
it 's a sweet spot .
it really was n't funny .
thumbs down guys !
this place fails .
this meal was definitely not up to the reputation to say the least .
there is an employee named melissa who flat out lies to your face .
been on here a few times and it 's amazing every time !
i was disgusted .
i went here because my favorite pho soup restaurant was closed .
beers & wells are very reasonable .
soo i need to use a shopping cart for my three items .
"the meat was tender , the beans perfectly seasoned ."
"the lemon drop , which was recommended by the waitress was horrible ."
the girl 's up front are very nice .
friday is also a place to people watch it 's a packed house !
overall - the food was delicious and service was friendly .
"i called , was put on hold and then hung up on ."
the owner is awesome !
staff was rude and apathetic during our stay .
both were delicious !
the drinks are also really good .
their home-made tortillas are great too .
a few hours later my stomach was hurting so much .
it was the perfect combination for a hot night .
fine and fresh ingredients prepared to absolute perfection .
thank you wendy .
"terrible pizza , tasted like it was from a box ."
the couch days were great .
after the facial my face felt so clean and light .
their bar has the best prices !
always a great haircut and the scalp and should massage are always welcome !
bread was not warmed and it was stale .
"to me , that is unacceptable ."
it 's great stuff !
their nachos & spinach artichoke dip are n't bad .
bandera is pricey but worth it .
you found it .
the atmosphere and service were also very good .
"their staff is efficient , friendly , and accomodating ."
it was well worth the long drive and we will plan to be back !
this place is such a rip off .
i was very pleased by everyone !
charlie and his crew provide excellent customer and car service !
dh & i came to bravo bistro tonight .
"bread is amazing , all around ."
this place is great .
went in tonight and the place was empty but the food was so good .
"the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry ."
everything went smooth and our dogs seemed happy upon our return .
loved this experience .
"( it 's really dated inside , to boot . )"
i still ca n't believed this happened .
the price of the food and drinks is just right too .
they are very accommodating and helpful .
thought nothing of it .
the guys were really nice and quick .
we traveled two hours to see the vehicle only to be greatly disappointed .
i was very disappointed with our service at ra .
as for me this seems like a fun place to spend a lazy afternoon .
"after a family emergency , i had to cancel my appointment at this resort ."
"when i pointed out his mistake , he still did n't believe me ."
upon entering i realized something was very different - there was hardly any suits .
"unfortunately , i had very poor service during my last visit ."
the entire set up was not even relaxing .
it was truly bad !
"for $ _num_ , it was incredibly disappointing ."
the food was very good .
"if i come again , i 'll probably get all vegetarian sushi ."
the food and service were the best i ever had .
best chinese food i have tried in scottsdale .
very stingy when i asked for my money back .
"sometimes the rice is hot , sometimes it 's cold ."
"they serve starbucks coffee , but lack the fancy machines ."
"wings were good though , but it was hard to order them ."
their margaritas are great !
service was slow and it was n't even busy .
my family has found a new bakery in town !
the waitresses are friendly and very attentive .
"sure , the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it ."
this business was recommended by people at my church .
"i highly recommend the steak tacos , to die for !"
how i miss the good old days .
"i got a burrito with shredded beef , and it was delicious ."
"manicure was good , service was not great , and pedi was terrible ."
"our waitress , ( lauren ) knew the beer , was very attentive ."
the decision was made for them to return the following week on tuesday .
i had also visited another specialist and had an mri done .
good price for what you got .
i ordered the chicken plate which was huge and delicious .
what i remembered was nothing like that .
there pizza is always hot and fresh .
absolutely delicious and the waitress was a sweetheart .
knowledgeable doctors who made me feel comfortable about my first visit to the chiropractor .
it did n't have a lot of flavor and not enough toppings .
"and for dessert , their cheesecake is the best i have ever eaten ."
these guys are so smart !
i have a few friends living here and the place is just too big .
they have a ton of spicy food selections that i love .
what may have once been shabby chic is now disgusting .
the marquee just plain stinks .
"they had games , food trucks , and various vendors in a beautiful setting ."
the event really made us want to go back for dinner !

he then proceeded to clear all of our drinks off the table .

service was fast and friendly !
i got in my car and drove off but i did n't like this .
the service is impeccable !
the chicken parm was okay .
i 'm in love with this place and their tacos .
the absolute worst excuse for a gyro i have ever had .
the food actually impressed me !
the place was clean and the staff was friendly .
they also have really good prices on boxes of citrus .
i gave the hostess my order and waited at the bar .
totally listens and understands my concerns and answers any questions i have .
the burro was small for $ _num_ and not very filling .
i 've been here several times and every time has been great .
first of all our waiter was terrible and the food was so so .
"corned beef hash is homemade and great , burgers are great too ."
i love this place .
but the attitude of the girl on the phone was extremely rude .
service was mediocre .
thumbs up for that .
and that is good because one or two sizes does not fit all .
"that included _num_ bud lights , which were cold and refreshing ."
"also , the food was amazing !"
i tried the chef salad and the quality was just low .
however for the portion you get it in pretty expensive .

i am a single mom of _num_ little ones and make very little .
the staff was friendly and helpful .
"the sauce on it is great , and the portion is gigantic ."
they have boiled bagels and are wonderful .
i love this place .
they come in a nice sized glass and are plenty strong .
did n't speak to me through my entire transaction .
service was enthusiastic and well done .
"food is great , portions are huge , & good prices ."
someone needs to do a better job managing this location .
the customer next to us had the lobster and was also big time disappointed .
"the chicken was overcooked , though i liked the shrimp and the tofu ."
"the food was delicious , however i felt like it was overpriced ."
the food was just perfect and as advertised .
"the pita is supposed to hold the food , not just be around it ."
servers attention was elsewhere ... never listened to our order .
i have found they have good food and good service .
"and speaking of food , it 's crappy half the time now ."
the entire staff is so warm and fun !
i highly recommend taking your car to them !
this place is the truth !
"the waiter never came back , never offered coffee , dessert or anything ."
"his steak has always been amazing , they are very consistent ."
atmosphere was fine & the service was excellent .
"the pizza with artichokes , sausage and prosciutto was so-so ."
she does n't belong in the service industry !
and the best breads make the best sandwiches .
aside from refills on drinks we did n't see our server the entire time .
good if you 're sitting upstairs .
she seemed irritated and threw the three menus on our table .
i was very impressed with jennifer 's knowledge and skilled technique .
"finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp ."
"we requested him again , however he was not scheduled until later that evening ."
the food and service here is phenomenal !
the food is fresh and well prepared .
well i took one bite and did not eat another .
my nails looked worse than when i walked in .
this place sucks .
out here for spring training and it has amazing food and a great atmosphere .
and then a cockroach walked across my table !
you could tell he was over worked and they were obviously understaffed .
loved my sandwich !
had a really good time since it was happy hour .
my friend got a cheeseburger and i got the prime steak .
the portions are great and the food is outstanding .
"but since we had an expectations , unfortunately the experience fell way short ."
they were very basic and nothing special .
my three year old had a blast at a friends ' birthday party .
our servers were extremely friendly and professional .
"as arby 's go , this one is a bit above the rest ."
i do n't eat burgers unless they are well done .
"the food is also always delicious , especially the chicken club and sushi ."
"they chatted for a few minutes , and he left their table ."
orange table is my new obsession !
"it 's bland , slightly dry and just not there anymore ."
i recommend this place for the food and service .
it 's dark and intimate inside with a great wine selection .
you need to get your old chef back .
it 's greasy as can be .
the restaurant is elegant with a menu to match .
"history or no history , the sugar bowl has lost this customer for good ."
"they pizza is good , and they have _num_ or so specials ."
you only ever see a pa never the doctor .
"we left , no service at all ."
said it would be another _num_ min .
i always buy my favorite wine here .
i had to wait for _num_ minutes with no apology or explanation .
"mike , the manager , was very pleasant ."
have eaten here a couple times and really enjoy the food .
menu is very limited .
this is the worst venue i have ever been to !
to him it 's a sin to leave any bacon behind .
we come from new mexico and our mexican food is different .
the downstairs units are horrid for one major reason .
the framing was a mess !
"i have to fill in , not take away ."
"look to see what they have coming , and go out and enjoy ."
i tried paying with my debit card and unfortunately it was declined .
these guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around .
the rest of the meat selection is also no good .
this place is awesome !
they do great work and are very reliable .
we went in and the place was cute and totally empty .
this place still kicks ass .
they explained everything well and provide excellent customer service .
ron is always honest about what my vehicle needs .
sarah jane is amazing and i recommend you go and see her today !
yummy the french toast is a must .
everyone i was with loved their food and we all plan on going back .

this ends today sadly .
absolutely loved my chicken enchilada !
this quaint produce market is a gem .
"too broad a choice for most chefs , and this one was no different ."
you guys are awesome .
"the pizza was good , but the service was slow ."
we went for the steak and were highly disappointed .
i do n't complain unless it 's reasonable enough to complain .
green chile is excellent .
they welcome you like family .
family friendly place is always a plus in my book !
jon was skilled and efficient .
"oh yeah , the hotel is old , tired and run down ."
loved it !
so you know how bad the course is ... no you do n't ?
they are extremely unprofessional to deal with .
it was right there and i had the time .
the staff was very friendly and very professional .
the sandwich had a ton of meat and tasted great on their fresh bread .
look at other reviews and i agree with how bad this place is .
there is n't a single reason to settle for horrible service .
"thanks leah , you are awesome !"
their pricing is very fair and the service has been good .
it was disappointing .
got it !
this place is wonderful !
the wait staff and dcor was also very pleasant .
very affordable & loving staff who do care about animals !
"this place has atmosphere , great service and `` big ass '' food ."
they require a _num_ day written letter for leaving .
talked to another family in the parking lot .
they truly care about the animals that are coming in .
i ordered a breakfast burrito & it was delicious !
jennifer is incredibly nice and knowledgable .
the fresh baked on site bread is amazing !
the pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour .
the pancake was delicious .
very good mexican food me and my wife love this place !
i am recommending this company to everyone and i will be a repeat customer !
they also have a constant stream of people coming through .
and jeff does n't work there anymore .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
"service is incredible as is the food ... fresh , flavorful and reasonably priced ."
they always hook us up with a pretty unique deserts .
so authentic they barely speak english and it shows in there food .
we were really pleased .
she 's got a perfect personality for the nail biz .
we get to the pool ... empty .
"the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again ."
i absolutely love this place !
but i order here often as its just high quality all the time .
_num_ of the _num_ orders were delivered .
"if i had a chance , i would of gone elsewhere ."
the staff is poorly trained .
everything looks great and works just like it should .
"ate , asked for check , and again a lengthy wait ."
$ _num_ for ice tea for _num_ person served in a clear solo cups .
they catered food for us also and all the guests loved it .
happy hour menu is incredible .
love how everyone is in the spirit .
the server was not attentive .
the furnishings and amenities are not quality .
"the service was great , the food was awesome ."
all the guys here are very kind & helpful .
the bone in ribeye was especially flavorful and bold with the open flame char .
my favorite thing here has got to be the orange blossom .
"this place , at least today , did n't offer that ."
there really are quite a few very good spots for taking pictures .
"i did n't get our servers name , but he was cordial and efficient ."
"a friend asked me about this review , almost a year later ."
but by far the best thing this place has to offer is the food .
"they did an excellent job , even the paint was a perfect match ."
this is a must for all local in the phoenix area .
so many options of healthy food i love it !
this place is a great find .
"so personable and very caring , i felt like a true bride there !"
becky did my hair and she was awesome !
the website says nothing about the store being closed .
out door seating that is nice during the cooler times of year .
this old town landmark still serves the best ribs in the valley .
it 's a nice course .
"my husband always gets the eggs benedict , and he loves it !"
it is such a pleasure to come here every time .
their prices are good for this area .
"first off , they no longer include mimosas ."
i love this place .
ah no i do n't think so .
clearly he pissed off more than one customer that day and got us confused .
this is my favorite mexican food restaurant .
the baristas are always so friendly as well .
the sauce for the gyros is amazing and goes great on everything .
i love this office !
there is no order or procedures .
an extra bonus is the amazing gelato shop next door .
"just posted a new , long review to explain ."
"now the food , drinks , and desserts are amazing ."
i will not be back anytime soon which is a shame .
the closest thing is the new italian restaurant by chris bianco .
not some place i 'm dying to spend my money .
"lastly , we asked the owner of the restaurant he was the worst ."
we had been here maybe _num_ years ago and did not remember much .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
the one i want is $ _num_ .
run down is an understatement .
"came here for my friends ' wedding and wow , what a gorgeous place !"
the service was fast and friendly !
bought it and some gum and hit the door .
barros pizza is excellent .
we love sweet cakes !
"seriously save yourself the time , money , and frustration go anywhere but here !"
does the state really even know about this place ?
this is the worst car wash i 've ever been to .
i highly recommend it !
"it took forever to get drink refills , salsa for our chips , etc ."
the food was mediocre at best .
this is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat .
tip : the place is always full in the evening so get there early .
"no , on second thought , it 's no shame at all ."
the price is good as well .
got my oil done here the other day .
we got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting .
cant understand why there were so many customers there .
this is the worst place to live .
food and services were terrible -- will not return .
she was such a great help !
i 'm `` _num_ % sure '' she wont be getting a tip ... .
our server could n't tell me what was in the stuffed mushrooms .
patio is loud .
thank you !
it was so salty that it was not edible .
helps pay for your gas !
this place is horrible .
we had a group of six and waited _num_ minutes for sushi orders .
it 's become my favorite thing to do in arizona beside the water park .
i love coming here for the comfort food and the quality has never disappointed .
honestly it was n't very good at all .
i also liked several of their wall mirrors as well as buffet lamps .
they are unpleasant and condescending .
kevin is very honest and knowledgable .
"the pool was amazing , and the service was great ."
what 's worse is that i had been going to this resort for years .
tortillas are always stale .
just not when it actually matters for their residents .
highly recommend it !
still in my mind as the best place i 've ever been .
so $ _num_ off the tab was the only option they given me.
worst place i have ever lived !
but overall they were good people !
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
the drive thru was backed up with no food going out .
"did no massage , says it 's only for deluxe pedicure ."
always saw this places packed and finally know why !
the show is very entertaining and the musicians are very talented .
i had no choice but to bump this down to _num_ stars .
they have _num_ basketball for court .
i love frank and lupe 's !
and i was assured there within walking distance .
the price for this place is very reasonable since you are in scottsdale .
was able to get seated right away and the food was delicious .
"but this was onion , onion , onion ."
these guys are pricey but good and addictive .
the dinners were perfect - pork and lamb .
perfect spot for anyone who loves sports and great food .
i am so pleased .
glad i found this dentist !
my favorite dish is sweet and sour chicken w white rice .
my order was perfect and in a timely fashion .
shea was also super helpful and caring !
"although the drinks get made , the service is terrible ."
"he did n't either , and was very clearly upset about being alone ."
when i entered this place i was confused if they were open or not .
"unfortunately , the owner does not carry these same qualities ."
the waitress was a little very sweet and did a great job .
i had _num_ work shirts that my company gave me and they fit awful .
this is certainly a must .
did n't have big expectations but was pleasantly surprised .
the food was great and would definitely return .
the food came when they said it would and it was hot !
i had to wait for a complete do over .
"but as you might assume , it was a huge problem !"
my favorite is the chicken mole .
saturday nights it 's a nice place to bring the family .
thank you for a great experience !
very good prices and staff is very nice & professional .
"very good food , the green flannel was spectacular , highly recommended ."
tiny spent care cutting my hair and she was amazing .
thank you dodge !
their chicken pita is great too .
epic fail for this pei wei .
my friend even had the liver & onions & was pleased .
"had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' ."
their pricing is super affordable and the food is delicious !
let 's be real guys - the room was $ _num_ a night .
when i need new tires i will definitely be going back .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
the vibe was great - very neighborhood .
"it was n't bad , but it was n't really good either ."
i encourage everyone o spread the word and start standing up for yourself .
the carmel and chocolate sundaes were ok but nothing spectacular .
the people who work here are the best .
"the restaurant is full of energy , comfortable , and the food is great ."
so when i called i was told they are _num_ minutes away .
the prime rib i had was perfectly cooked and was enough for two meals .
"the place was n't that busy , it was steady ."
it was awful .
she did not apologize or anything .
got it !
i really liked this place .
it is always busy and always worth the wait .
the pork chops where amazing also !
this has not been an enjoyable customer service experience so far .

nigiri : fish was stale .

guess he assumed i would n't understand .
it is great !
either it 's poor service or it happens all the time .
best pizza in az hands down .

"as always , they have great displays and cool pop stuff ."
beautiful grounds and we had a wonderful meal at sunset .
"oddly , combined with how good the food is , it is quite charming ."
"it 's quite simple , really ."
the big problem was the waiter and waitress .
the bartenders are above average and the owner is super friendly and involved .
it appears there is no bus staff or management as well !

"sadly , the hollandaise sauce tasted more like lemonade than hollandaise ."
i love that feel of the place .
the food was delicious !
called over a skinny tall skin head to help kick us out .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
as i cut into the chicken it did n't cut like normal chicken .
this location is still a favorite with the super high ceiling .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
i love bbq so that helps .
was not a good example of the country inn and suite standard .
"if you 're looking for a good karaoke bar , i recommend looking elsewhere ."
go to frys they know how to treat the customer .
i got the worst hair cut here !
this is by far the best storage place i have used .
"today ( at least at this location ) , i was wrong ."

service staff is very knowledgeable as well .
got nothing .
: ) we were happy to try it out ... .
for dessert we all shared _num_ cannolis which tasted heavenly .
"will overlook the bad service , cause the place is great ."
the owner gives a year warranty on the replacement .
"this place is expensive , especially for what it is ."
it was a lovely experience for my first ever tiffany 's purchase !
great customer service is just as important as the food .
i really love them !
"deplorable , is how i describe my experience at the breakfast club ."
we also had calamari to start and it was very good .
maybe he gets into trouble for not immediately filling up waters or taking plates ?
but my order was completely wrong and not complete .
we had burger and roast beef sandwiches .
the gentleman did have an attitude .
"much to my surprise ( and delight ) , there was room to move !"
this place was pretty good .
quality is huge and fun atmosphere .
"parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess ."
they have such a large selection of boots and cute clothes .
both were great and came with a tasty green chile rice .
this place is now my go to italian spot .
they get some really good deal on fruits and they are never the same .
nail tech did excellent job .
the atmosphere is fun and unique .
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
"gee , guess i should be grateful ."
"each were delicious , fresh , generously portioned and very affordable ."

it is n't going to happen .
music is extremely loud .
overall i really like it and will come back for more .
thank you everybody !
but my stay actually went quite smooth .
"this was not , despite the length , intended to be a rant ."
just about every single order we have put in for delivery has been wrong .
i do n't think so and i will never go back here again .
they were too perfect .
maybe the burger and i were n't a good match today ... .
"once our food finally came out , things didnt get any better ."
i give it four stars for being new and bright and nicely laid out .
the food was good and the staff was without exception excellent .
smelled and tasted terrible .
know your company policies and do n't inconvenience the customer !
"great customer service ; the crew here were all very helpful , even honest ."
everyone deserves a second chance to make things right .
"but , alas , no such luck if the dining area is closed !"
your website says nothing about this .
it was not melted or seared in as i was expecting .
gas pumps are very nearly useless .
"if you love spring training baseball , this is the place to go ."

"unfortunately , the whole eating experience was underwhelming ."
this is a local dive bar with great bar food .
they hardly mix the ice cream and its run by a bunch of kids .

it was worth the drive .
i have had better chowder at a lower price .
the staff was wonderful and very accommodating to whatever needs you have .

"geez , it 's always such a treat to come here ."
just got back from a great meal at blue adobe grille .
there was salt all over it and crumbs .
"the veggies , where not steamed enough , and mash seemed old ."
it 's worth the wait .
he 's always cheerful and having us try his new sushi creations .
i had corned beef with eggs over easy hash browns and toast .

the sushi is just barely above average .
the tortilla was really fresh which was a nice surprise !
best thai we 've ever had !
the resort is beautiful and the spa is amazing .

i always recommend your store and the feedback is always positive .

over priced and the stores always seem to be dirty .
"after the staff member left , i went to the counter ."

kfc is just down the road .
the mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box .
it 's a keeper !

we tried rush street and loved it .
grazie is a special place to me .

after we showed up for our reservation we waited another _num_ minutes .
it 's just insane .
this is a fantastic property .
for a great dessert place i highly recommend the sugar bowl .
"wonderful food , classes that are a delight ."
has gone completely down hill to the point where they are extremely rude .
the service is spot on even in a usually full restaurant .
not to sound like a broken record ... but everyone here is right .
food server was very pleasant and always had a nice smile .
she looked very busy .
it was good .
guys like bob just do what 's right and in the process build goodwill .
then i asked for the managers name and she would not give it .
the whole process was handled well from start to finish .
it also was supposed to include a cut .
rosita 's was a real disappointment .
"chances are , anything you order there , will be a surprise ."
the food was delicious with gigantic portions .
"the real point is , you really do get what you pay for ."
she has since been replaced with another receptionist .
"the environment was nice , the service was great !"
he 's also extra soft .
the french press coffee was so good .
we probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a korean bbq joint .
"as a general rule , i avoid sushi in arizona ."

i feel the rates are reasonable as well .
do yourself a favor and do n't fall for it .
"the landscaping crew keeps the grounds impeccable , truly amazing !"
the food is good and the service is always quick .
almost like there was mayonnaise in it .
"we got an orange soda , cherry pepsi and a kid pepsi ."

we definitely added more on top of the gratuity .

this place is not the same !
i had a very tasty steak that was cooked to perfection .
"the quality of the service , the food and the entire staff was excellent ."
the worst motel _num_ is better kept up than this .
so be aggressive when you want something !
"it 's out of our way , but we 'll definitely come back ."
he just sat them down .
just to be clear im the only other customer here right now .
we had a groupon and he would not honor it .
this place has a great twist to mexican food !
"was ignored for quite a while , then was finally helped ."
"the green beans did n't taste fresh , much more like canned vegetables ."
left a message that i wanted to place an order .
the whole sandwich was just gross .
"walked outside , and he was on his cell phone smoking a cigarette ."
got a breakfast burrito chimi style .

this place is a shit hole with shit service .
the place is packed every morning .
the pies are awesome !
"essentially , i trust these guys ."
i actually prefer this coffee shop over starbucks .
"i highly recommend the fresh , not creamy , option ."
"man , that was a disaster !"
but the food was n't worth the cost .
and walked away .
our wedding was perfect thanks to you !
& fresh beef jerky if you 're really lucky !
this place just has a cool factor all its own .
the service is impeccable and the food authentic .
fried calamari hit the spot as appetizer .
even their bar food misses the mark .
plus my corn tortillas were far from fresh !
our sales person david roy was the absolute best .
i 'll keep coming here until i find something better .
"he returned my call and said , oh it wasnt on the truck again ."
all staff was extremely professional and the food was amazing .
the slices are huge and sooo delicious .
i love this place !

after the show we learned there was some sort of sewage problem going on .
"they have a huge selection of tap beers , like beyond imaginable ."
it was a great surprise after all that driving and definitely worth the trip .
audio on the 2nd floor was challenging at best .
we had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food .

service was top-notch and atmosphere was great !
it 's a definite must !
"i 'm not your enemy , in fact we have never met ."
i was not impressed at all .
it so `` i hate my life !

"the employees are professional and nice , helpful ."
i love this place and i 'm a customer for life !
i highly recommend the sizzling rice soup !
staff is very helpful .
"sorry to say , it was n't even worth that ."
"then my boyfriend walked in , who also was not greeted ."
i highly recommend both of these .
he is hilarious and will have me coming back !
they lost me as a customer .
i immediately felt comfortable and will be coming back .
we love it !
this is _num_ % true .

the vinyl came out ok the carpet on the other hand not so good .

"also the slice specials , were simply cheese ."
it 's a very fun space with a lot of talent .
drinks always stay full and food tastes great !
i would have understood if it had been busy but it was n't !
their employees have always been extremely friendly .
there was a beautiful aquarium near the sushi bar .
the pizza is by far the best over dominos .

the curries are excellent and the service is always quick and friendly .
are you kidding me ?
none of us used the bathroom .
never been there ... scared away by the name .

none of the employees take pride of the property .
"first of all , they were quite expensive ."
"the food , fruits and flowers are extraordinary ."
"it 's nice and small , so there is a lot of interaction ."
has consistently gone over and above for me .
i love this place for both food and atmosphere .
the service was prompt and friendly .
they were both delicious !
"if the food was exceptional , i would n't bother at all ."
they had a good selection of places to eat and the staff was friendly .
it 's a little pricey but in my opinion it 's well worth it .

"the room smelled musty , was dated and felt kinda gross ."
everyone is super friendly as well .
i called right away and was able to get an appointment very easily .
it was paired with corn and grits and the combination was outstanding .
it is obvious the owners do n't care about their customers .
"our server was friendly , attentive and knowledgeable ."
a few hours later another chips as i am driving .
"i love nordstrom , let me start off my saying that ."
waited again over _num_ minutes for anyone to even give us menus .
"overrated , you can stop reading now that all you need to know ."
which they should have stated the first time she went to pick it up .
"they also have horrible tv service , wtf ?"
"the cold air poured around the door , which made my adult daughter uncomfortable ."
they do have an outstanding ranch though .
we were out having fun .
now i remember why i do n't come here .
they do n't even serve me the cook does .
"overall , they made my first experience ordering flowers online a very pleasant experience ."
god i love pei wei .

the problem started when our food was delivered before the wine .

my hubby and i checked it out the other day while in the area .
these few things made the place seem unclean .
they failed to mention it until we seen the sign .

the owners are so amazing and accommodating .
nicole has always been very rude and short .
food did not taste fresh at all .
it 's horrible .

my husband and i looked forward to celebrating our anniversary at elements .
the orange chicken & lettuce wraps are amazing .
"also , their bruschetta was not good at all ."

would n't go back unless i had already eaten .
mark diagnosed it and repaired it first try .
i liked this place .
maybe they have changed their hours but i do n't go back .
"we ended up staying , only because the kids were hungry ."
the whole experience was outstanding .
the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly .
neither of the women were very nice or professional .
"worked with scott via email , phone , and in person ."
if your willing to wait though this is a great spot .
and again the food is excellent .
possibly the best restaurant fare i have ever eaten of any cuisine .
"never , i repeat , never go after 4pm ."
this might be a harsh review but i gave them _num_ chances .
the dentists are fine but the way the office is run is horrible .
i visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash .
it 's nothing fancy and does it 's job well !
my first full body massage ever and it was amazing !
it 's delicious !
"husband had the panang curry , which he very much enjoyed ."
i do n't get it .
the art is wonderful and the prices are really affordable .
i am more than just a little bit pissed about it .
all the food is very classic american style and delicious .
brought some people from out of town .
we stayed to finish our drinks and enjoyed the music .
i could n't find a spot initially because the lot was so full .
amazing management amazing employees everybody is so happy and genuine .
the general crowd consists of a majority of very fascinating regulars .
i 'm a fan !
had a great time .
portions are generous and dishes extremely tasty and authentic ( family owned ) !
this is a small business restaurant run very well .
does n't taste authentic at all .
the food was awful .
"and because of that , she tried to cut corners to save time ."
we placed our entree order and our food was just ... bad .
the vegas roll is my absolute favorite !
it felt chaotic and rushed .
but we had a great time ; the grounds and pools were beautiful .
it was way over-cooked and not really spicy .
celebrate an anniversary and it was amazing .
"so ... we were like okay , whatever ."
"at this point , i was ready to walk out ."
one of the best skate shops i 've visited in az .
we always make sure we have joe 's when we travel to scottsdale .
"as with the meat , they put only a small cut on each sandwich ."
drinks are made by really good bartenders .
everyone is always willing to help .
much of what other yelpers has written is true .
the views are unbeatable and perfect setting tucked into paradise valley .
defiantly recommend .
the new tv 's are a great addition .
my iced tea was never refilled .
so it works !
not what you want to see !
"it 's refreshing , however , to see more whimsical work on display ."
"if that 's the case , they are wonderful ."
they are usually pretty good to us .
had a nice experience !
the atmosphere is great and the bartenders are awesome .
it is not a huge place !
"friendly and fast drive-thru , great tortillas and flavorful pulled chicken ."
"words like quaint , charming , and old fashioned come to mind ."
i love this place .
needless to say we did n't order dessert .
i love their viet .
"as every waiter at every $ _num_ dive says , `` enjoy '' ."
they give boring dinner rolls with dinner now instead of the yummy corn bread .
the flourless chocolate cake was one of the best desserts i 've ever had .
i have been there and the food is spot on perfect !
the problem is the rudeness of the staff there .
they do n't want to create satisfied guests every time .
tina there is so awesome !
i normally go for reverse happy hour on sundays !
this required a good amount of time for me to clean off .
no one on the staff recognized the special occasion .
this restaurant is always freezing cold and dirty .
we left early so we could sit down and have a drink .
( and thats a great thing ) .
my dad and i split a whole combo sandwich .
"i wanted to like this place , i really did ."
the menu and food is great and the wait staff is professional .
so i was extremely dissappointed .
rooms are awesome !
the service was good but not enough to bring me back .
surprisingly that was not enough either .
this one was room temperature and was perfect .
the staff is very good at making my children feel comfortable .
i moved here four years ago and wanted a good mexican place .
the work was messy !
"the service is great , and the food never disappoints ."
thank you for your wonderful service .
the food is great !
is there a no star rating ?
they are great about shipping out of state which i take full advantage of .
this is a good store for your beauty needs .
this place has really gone downhill .
only for both of them to leave once the spouse returned .
the inside was as amazing as i remembered and so was the food !
"the food was excellent , reasonably priced and quickly served ."
the staff was so friendly !
growing up i always had the spaghetti with meatballs yum !
"the food is wonderful , one of the better steaks i have ever tasted ."
the pizza is so good and it never disappoints .
"i 'm sorry to hear about the groomers emergency situation , rachel ."
i have also been experiencing mediocre service .
this place is awesome !
"was able to see the sunset , while we ate dinner ."
my favorite dishes are : artichoke heart as an appetizer is unreal .
i was referred to this office by a friend and will always be thankful !
the inside is a little small and crowded and not good for group lunches .
"food , service , and atmosphere were all top notch !"
the food was delicious and the service was exceptional .
we moved from across the country into this crap hole .
definitely go italian .
it 's cluttered with beer cans and the smell of dead fish !
my experience was horrible .
it 's 6:30 now on thursday night and we are the only table .
then i checked amazon and they were $ _num_ .
check it out for yourself to understand how glorious it really is !
clean and organized tho !
the biggest upset was our takeout order did not come with chips .
i had to follow up in person at the nursery to state my concerns .
upon speaking the restaurant they did n't care .
the building is old and yuck .
another server came back with my beer and it was a blue moon .
the rest of the entres at the table were delicious .
i actually felt bad for the waitresses .
"everything i 've tried here is very delicious , i love this place ."
talked and smoked with his co worker outside .
"hers was ok , a little too rare ."
favorite spot is seated at the sushi bar at the back of the restaurant .
i really enjoyed my trip to this store today .
guys you can trust with your vehicle ... they are soooo honest and friendly .
i think i 'll stick to drinks only from now on .
"i may be a girl , but i 'm not stupid !"
my best friend and i had a blast on the tour .
they also have half their sodas out of order every time .
i am happy to have found sweet and sour pork .
my entire family sees him and we all love him .
my nails look absolutely horrible .
"the food was very mediocre - not terrible , but nothing special ."
`` why not complain to management '' you say ?
"prices are reasonable , very clean and staff very friendly ."
"always good service , never a wait , was quick for take out too ."
we had the antipasto platter and it was great .
this is my third time using amazing carpet and tile cleaning .
so glad we stumbled upon this place last weekend !
i will never return no matter how badly i want to see the act .
forced to pay them to package a box they shipped me themselves .
"however , once we got rolling she was fairly attentive ."
the green chile burritos were so flavorful and the sauce was amazing !
the atmosphere and staff were great as was the food .
"in my experience , staff has always been friendly and attentive ."
this is an amazing restaurant .
katie delivered stellar service .
one thing is for sure -- they 'll be my jeweler for life !
i tried the pecan chicken salad and it was very good .
thank you so much adobe five-star all the way !
the az restaurant specials were a great deal to take advantage of .
thank you .
green rice sounds funny but taste fantastic .
"seriously , that 's how bad their customer service is ."
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
"i ordered a special , lobster risotto and it was superb ."
thank you stephen !
hummus was awesome and kabob was really good .
and for the most part crap bands play here .
"it was a second floor unit , which was wrong ."
its well worth the drive if you do n't live close by .
the burger was small and very thin .
it tasted fresh and delicious .
it is amazing .
the staff is rude and not very intelligent .
the six of us went out for yogurt because we were really very hungry .
they 've been here forever and they 're super nice people .
the buffet is now one of the worst indian buffets in town .
got $ _num_ back in change .
however the staff left me quite wanting .
they quoted a price for a problem and fixed it .
i literally live _num_ mins from this place .
$ _num_ for breakfast was not worth it .
i finally see it .
the owner is very unfriendly .
the bathrooms are old and gross .
if your open to driving _num_ minutes the hilton is a much better option .
"seriously though , i have never shopped here ."
my husband and i were really impressed with this little place !
i have referred many family and friends and will continue to refer people .
the girl working there was super nice and accommodating .
management is even worse .
arizona bread company is simple in looks but their bread speaks wonders .
the pizza here is so yummy !
then ordered chips and salsa ; we 've had better .
the salsa was watery and i could have made the enchiladas much better myself .
the best part of this restaurant was definitely the service .
my dr pepper ribs were excellent and very tender .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
this place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant .
they actually look forward to going to the dentist !
staff here are friendly and helpful each time i have been .
then we got a large pepperoni pizza and added meatballs .
"so , i asked if i could put a little ice in the mug ."
i did n't get to enjoy the cafe downstairs but it looked good .
everything i 've had here has been great .
highly recommend santisi !
unfriendly the entire time so asked to speak to the manager .
drinks are well-made and well-priced .
"if you like a dark room , this is not your place ."
they apparently lay it on a grill and forget it !
this wine bar has an attentive staff and very romantic setting .
i get that but these are extreme and i talked to him several times .
"everyone was nice , received our food pretty quickly ."
"just had lunch , server was great and food fantastic ."
my wife ordered the fried ( formerly broasted ) chicken .
makes a great family get away in march or april .
meatball waited on us and he made excellent food and beverage recommendations !
it is honestly heaven .
we always have a good time when we go here .
you 'll see why once you get there .
great family owned business where the owner and employees truly love dogs .
the place was pretty full and we decided to try it .
rooms are clean and staff is very friendly .
both meals were excellent .
our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful .
also the gym is huge but none of the equipment works !
i was not offered a menu when i got there .
it 's packed .
i love love this place .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
"like i said , i wish i did ."
i am looking for recommendations of decent pizza delivery in south scottsdale .
especially when there are only _num_ people in the whole restaurant .
the bbq salmon is amazing !
we stayed recently in a very nice suite .
enjoyed our stay here .
the sundaes looked like delectable old-fashioned fun .
great little place ; glad i found them .
the coffee really is n't worth it .
james elliot and his team are the best .
"we ordered chowder and fried cod , with fries and coleslaw ."
i went here with my father in law and my _num_ year old daughter .
took us about _num_ min to place order which was fine ; rush hour .
"there is a wide variety of meats and veggies , noodles , etc ."
the day of installation brought justin and roy to install .
"food was fresh , well prepared and delicious ."
"well , my experience was different than anything i read here !"
egg drop soup and garlic chicken are among my top choices .
i had frank 's enchilada plate and it was wonderful .
"express took your business due to poor customer service , and experience ."
"food is great , and patio is very nice ."
the chili dog was bland .
i asked if they had replaced the spare and he told me no .
but the worst thing is the owner .
there was only one cook .
but this last chance was the last straw .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
what won me over completely was the customer service .
she 's a doll !
we love it !
one of the best french onion soups i 've had .
the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy and the service is great .
"it is a cute little facility with a very calm , cute hospital cat ."
i ordered a thai noodle dish with tofu and my bf ordered pad thai .
they always remember us and the food is real awesome italian food !
that is some serious customer service .
"i love the resort , the sanctuary , even more !"
"old , dirty and it looks smelly ."
"clean rooms , ample parking , well appointed suite style rooms that felt spacious ."
"service is usually pretty good , but either way their sundaes are delicious ."
this place is great !
i love malee 's !
the owner and his daughter are wonderful .
everyone loves the ride and education .
the ambience is nifty and the food is delicious .
we still love it after all these years !
my bite of monkey bread and the omelet were both good .
sugar bowl makes for a great hot afternoon treat .
we went here for my girlfriend 's birthday and i was impressed !
"we checked in , and the place was empty ."
i waited about _num_ or _num_ minutes and he never returned .
she is a gem !
the buffalo carpaccio here is amazing .
i promise you wo n't be upset if you go see emily !
about all this course offers is a lack of snow in winter !
the comedy spot is great !
the chile relleno i had was close to inedible .
the food is terrible .
"cousin had short ribs , a generous portion and found it very flavorful ."
we ended up having to spend a couple of hours apart .
"big ass burger is my one true love , besides my cat ."
this place is awesome .
"from start to finish , the service and experience were excellent ."
service is good and free wifi in the store .
drink menu had a nice mix .
they have great food for being a little dive bar .
i ended up later moving into a one bedroom by myself .
its become my new `` special occasion '' place !
the food is good too .
it is a little divey but that charm attracts only the best crowds .
this is a prime place to drink and dine .
my husband and i were not impressed .
it is overall an awesome property .
"it 's inexpensive , quick , and delicious ."
the buffet is not worth it .
once again the staff were wonderful .
this shop is a gem !
never washed his hands !
my parents absolutely loved it !
probably about the worst bloody mary i have ever had in my life !
i think the food is wonderful .
the drunken noodles ( ordered hot ) were amazing .
"the carpets are worn , etc ."
hands down the most honest auto shop i have ever encountered .
price is right .
by that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food .
the skin care shop is extremely reasonably priced and has great selection .
the whole front staff and doctors were just wonderful with our babies .
i had the pad thai with shrimp and chicken and it was delicious !
"apparently , this is happened to many people at the property ."
i 've already wasted time eating there .
i wish i could give salt cellar zero stars .
"great bands when they bring them in and interesting events , too ."
what we got was the total opposite .
it has become my favorite place for tilapia or steak .
ohhh and the shredded beef tacos are the best i 've ever had .
the cake was the best too !
it was lunch and it was dead .
definitely not a place to stay with the amount i paid .
grimaldi 's does pizza and does it terrific .
none the employees seem to know anything .
it deserves negative five .
"the ribs were ok , nothing spectacular ."
i am moving out early just to get away from here .
i have n't been to depot cantina in several years .
"it was our second time , our first visit being over _num_ years ago ."
this office is very friendly and efficient !
worst customer service i 've even encountered !
these people go above and beyond to make you feel at home .
green chili pork and rotisserie chicken flatbread was excellent .
the portions were large and extremely tasty .
all the employees were very helpful and i had an amazing experience .
made my stomach turn _num_ mins .
there was a good accordion player and the apple strudel was great .
"yes , that 's why i 'm here today ."
i 've been to almost every chinese restaurant in the valley and wow !
i loved what she did .
very bright and welcoming hosts i recommend this for your breakfast place to go .
they were n't strips at all but more like nuggets and way over cooked .
it will take you places you 've never been .
the service was fantastic the first night .
this place has gone downhill very fast .
"if you not eating , this is a great wine to sip on ."
have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet .
`` i liked this place .
they are all very nice people .
robert lemon initially called me and he was courteous and enjoyable on the phone .
i will never return here simply because the service was that bad .
this restaurant is actually in a cellar .
safe to say that i enjoy going to the dentist !
we ordered beer and beer bites .
she again told me to leave my phone as well .
"i 'm sorry , but me thinks not ."
the food is always excellent and service is great .
this set a very negative tone for the rest of our meal .
the burrito was not very good either .
several people got the fish tacos which also looked really good .
we also ordered fish that was way over cooked .
they have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good .
it seems to get worse each time i give it another try .
we ordered some dumpling and they were absolutely disgusting .
this is the best breakfast i have ever had !
went for breakfast with a friend and everything was really good !
the art in the alley behind it is cool too !
"when it 's _num_ out , you 'd rather have a completely enclosed hotel ."
"given my experience , i now have reservations when reading yelp review ."
i 've always been able to find what i need here !
it took a good _num_ months for the dresses to arrive .
`` your food tastes flavorless '' ?
"i was going to order a different drink , but the waiter never asked ."
there was no warning when i bought tickets for this venue .
we started with a house salad and enjoyed that quite a bit .
service is great !
the rice options are all very good .
and i loved their work .
the scottsdale pet hotel is nothing but amazing !
"went there twice , and wo n't go back ."
the green chile tamale was sweet and tasty .
the flank steak is my favorite .
food was really expensive .
"first , the prices are low and pieces are huge ."
"but come halloween and having fun , that seems a bit tacky and tasteless ."
the customer service is great .
all in all we paid _num_ dollars for _num_ hours use of the room .
a long time ago they charged for using a credit card .
instead we got dry tortillas ... at pita pit .
"basically , you 're getting ripped off ."
open seats in the bar are few & far between !
all were delicious !
the people here are just bad .
the ladies love it .
i had a cheesesteak last time i was there and it was great .
live music on the weekends is great and really brings in a good crowd .
we basically told him to screw off then walked home .
but it is worth it !
the guy at the parts counter said they could n't cut those keys .
"we ordered two more entrees , the steak which was excellent ."
i fly in from denver to see emily lopez .
the cooks do n't really know what they 're doing either .
i give it a `` hot damn !
tom and team - thank you !
they also have great happy hour specials on other drinks as well .
the horseradish sauce was absolutely divine .
the only condiment on the table was salt & pepper .
the fries and salad we good too .
"my advise , eat dinner before you come ."
waitress seemed bothered by us and checked us once our meals were finished .
everything but the wave roll was delicious and the bill was about $ _num_ .
abby did a excellent job on my hair cut and style .
the management does n't care about your living situations and are so disrespectful .
"in addition , they do not offer a military discount ."
everything was great !
definitely recommend .
some if the staff very unprofessional and program really does n't work .
i came here with a group of _num_ people for lunch .
"it was good , extremely reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread ."
service is always good .
if u ever have a chance to see him do it !
the salsa tasted like nasty .
i only eat here if it 's 2am and my neighbor wants pizza .
the eggs benedict are excellent .
that 's pretty hard to beat .
it often does not pass .
it 's a solid place for italian food with decent wine list .
only thing crazy about this place was the guy outside the front door .
all the servers treat you like you 've been coming there for years .
he did not really seem to be to sympathetic .
nikki has been a great help and all staff are so helpful .
i found it.
the seats are far from luxurious but they are comfortable enough .
it 's just gross .
elmer 's is very greasy and very good .
my family and i ate here just a few days ago .
newly built store has that 50s theme which adds a great taste to it .
"fresh ingredients , an outstanding menu and authentic charm make this a local favorite ."
"first off , when we called , we got the usual sales tactics ."
"they did however pay for that dish , but i will not be back ."
the prices are also very fair .
does anyone know what authentic chinese is ?
and like the salad it was just ok .
today was my first time here and unfortunately had a very bad experience .
this is my wife 's favorite place to eat in scottsdale .
the sports memorabilia is really cool too .
for some reason she thought i was weird for not drinking that .
the best philly cheesesteak in town !
it was absolutely delicious .
the employees are always super helpful and the selection is great .
if something breaks it usually takes a couple weeks before the machine is fixed .
rolls were delicious and unique .
it 's that bad .
i definitely recommend paradise valley florist !
waited another _num_ for the glass of wine .
filet was cooked perfectly as i ordered it- medium rare .
the dinning experience is great !
the fresh lunch options are amazing .
wow - everything we had here was really good .
the drive there is fabulous .
thank you !
the food was n't anything special .
they have an excellent selection of combos to choose from .
the carts are new and always clean and nice .
we saw several wild horses and lots of beautiful scenery !
enterprise made it super easy .
they obvious are n't environment friendly !
we went to don & charlie 's tonight and had the best time !
they also have several novelty items that are perfect for a gift !
they were a little spicy but waaaay too garlicky .
our dinner with our friends was a total disaster .
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
i am not happy leaving this place !
star _num_ : how were the portions relative to the cost ?
it is a perfect date spot .
but this place is so legit !
and it melts in your mouth the way good milk chocolate should .
food is always great .
thanks bosa for being great !
what kind of breakfast place does n't have cream cheese ?
which is really just an insult .
this food is not very good .
she gets _num_ stars !
she was not very friendly .
it was not removed like i asked .
my husband went here last night and had a great time .
it 's awesome !
"service for drinks were pretty good but for food , below average ."
"laurie is not only knowledgable , but she is professional and well trained ."
the appetizers were some of the worst i 've had in phoenix .
this place is really nice !
both were delicious and the sandwich was just as good the next day .
roaring fork has a great happy hour .
"i love their potstickers , crab cake salad and of course the margaritas !"
the decor is gorgeous and it is n't too loud inside .
it will be a long time before we consider going back to gammage .
every person that i visited with at the shop was friendly and helpful .
the flavors together were just not that good .
the staff that works there is amazing as well .
this is certainly my favorite place in the valley to get good thai food !
"the food , service and price were all fantastic !"
"the omelet i tried was delicious , service was great ."
service was a _num_ on a scale of _num_ to _num_ as well .
greg is the best !
"_num_ minutes later , we get our food ."
we got to emergency and she died less then an hour later .
the manager is horrible .
this place is a landmark start to any party !
would definitely recommend and call again in the future !
the pizza came about _num_ or so minutes later and it was so good !
i gave the waitress my card and she comes back saying it was declined .
hate that we wasted so much money there with our group .
good seafood does not happen in the desert .
they also have some delicious shakes .
this guy has no bedside manner and is rather unfriendly .
i always look forward to the next time that i will be back .
it looks great .
the sommelier chris is so wonderful !
just one thing it is small and quaint .
their staff and the owner were all very nice .
i actually avoided it the first night and went to another place .
extremely fast service food was out quick and fresh !
"its dark , the drinks are cheap , and theres room for great bands ."
i rescheduled an appointment for her to fix it .
their pizza is the best i have ever had as well as their ranch !
the owner is actually from germany and the food seems authentic .
"this place is the worst , most unprofessional business i have ever come across ."
who the hell pays nearly $ _num_ to get their teeth cleaned ?
came here for lunch with the family .
plus - he recovered quickly and graciously said he was buying our drinks .
she is a very very nice lady too !
i was unable to get a bite down without a drink .
our wedding day went off without a hitch !
great fresh fish and the cabbage gave it that perfect taste combination .
everyone there was nice and accommodating .
she then transferred the call to the assistant 's voicemail .
"we arrived on a sunday evening , there were _num_ other tables seated ."
if it was literally half the price this would be a 3-4 star review .
"the food was delicious , and came quickly despite it being very busy ."
this was the first time here and it was more than worth it .
the food is fresh and tasty !
"there is nothing fancy about the food , but it is always tasty ."
"the salads are ok , nothing special ."
the extensive wine list offers tremendous variety and does n't disappoint .
she was getting closer but still not rare let alone very rare .
"heck , i order the mango lassi for myself it 's so good !"
enchiladas with poblano cream sauce were excellent .
no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact .
had a great experience at roaring fork .
the service is wonderful and beautiful decor .
our server was the perfect blend of attentive but not hovering .
well _num_ days later he died !
my friend and i really enjoyed ourselves and i will be back again .
"they are knowledgable , professional and friendly !"
"this is a beautiful venue , like a smaller and nicer gammage ."
we came here on a sunday afternoon hoping to eat decent bar food .
unfortunately i had a very bad experience .
i love going here .
the finest meal and dining experience we have ever had .
"the pool is beautiful , and bikes on the property to rent ."
"brought my cameras in for a cleaning , and would highly recommend morris ."
i am such a freak for this place ... .
from start to finish she made the process so easy and enjoyable .
"everything we 've had has been good , including the service ."
management really needs to figure this out .
"i understand i was upside down on my vehicle , but this was ridiculous ."
brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked .
"other than that , it was a good experience ."
they did n't even wipe down the sink ?
when the food came one meal was not even there .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
their spaghetti pizza is also pretty darn good .
the service was poor .
"if you 're hungry , i recommend the rib eye ."
the hash was amazing as well as the omelet .
but the real treat is the oj that they sell on site ... .
"good service , though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm ."
"im in love with wings , just need to get my fix ."
everyone there is super nice and helpful !
i got the tamale sampler and it was really good .
janet does the most fabulous job with gel nails and pedicures .
_num_ pool is kind of small .
the service was definitely above and beyond .
the location is not fancy at all ... but this is top-notch thai food !
you 'd never guess looking from the outside how great the food is .
pizza is horrible .
best arby 's around !
this banquet hall does n't refund any money for any reason .
"the beans are pretty bad actually , as is the salsa ."
called the clinic and explained what was happening and they got us right in .
"wish it was closer to home , i 'd go more often ."
"the lamb fondue was so great , the trout , salads and chicken ."
i look forward to the next time i can indulge .
i suggest management train their staff and get rid of ones with attitude .
the food is definitely under priced .
do n't you want my money to do good ?
there were probably 4-5 people working and not many customers at all .
we had a great suite and really enjoyed the pools and the tennis courts .
thank you to the staff for everything you do !
_num_ months later i ordered a pair of prescription sunglasses .
_num_ comes still no pizza .
beyond disappointed i wasted _num_ hours here .
also had a classic manicure on a separate visit .
they would never had said anything ... .
overall this place was great .
they are a joy to work with !
kona is great for happy hour !
"that is sloppy , sloppy , sloppy ."
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
they served us huevos rancheros with burnt fries dried up cheese .
the ac is extremely loud and hard to sleep with .
atmosphere is excellent and food is just delightful !
"they are friendly , honest and always explain the work needed clearly ."
all he said was no and i had closed the chat window .
well i was disappointed .
love that you can chose heat level .
all you have to do is talk with your home room teacher .
no suggestions or assistance was offered .
the care and attention they gave my son and wife was top notch .
recommendations for making reservations during happy hour are spot on .
service here was as good as back home -- very friendly and helpful .
i had a very nice experience here .
she then offered to take half off the pizza .
"for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !"
"i gave him my name , and that was that -- it was cancelled ."
but i 'm not in a hurry to return .
cindy 's is pretty much amazing .
but the spinach salad was bad .

they also have a good wine selection .
( we live _num_ miles away . )
service was not poor food way to over priced !
this review is purely about the poor service experienced at this legendary location .

"prices are competitive , and customer service is average ."
i still hit this place any time i can .

place needs some tlc .

the service is always good and their other entrees are n't bad either .
everything about my experience was excellent .

kids will love this place as there is a small arcade .
either way it is always good .

suggested by someone we met and did not live up to the hype .
that 's the mark of a good tailor .
the tortellini soup is amazing and the many pasta dishes are wonderful .
they deserve no one 's business .
the fresh crispy cole slaw is bright and creamy at once .

oh dear does this jack off of a place deserve a whole star ?
the food is amazing .
it just was n't happening .
everything was made fresh and tasted it too .
it 's expensive but not worth the money .
the 1st rule of the breakfast club is never eat at the breakfast club .
"this place is all hype , but they do n't perform ."
i ordered an omelet my way and did not get it my way !

the breeze was lovely and all of the staff were attentive and friendly .
this my friend is not italian .
it was a pleasant surprise but honestly .
the only saving grace was that she did n't charge us for the coffee .
the pastas and salads are as good as any .
the second best part was the pomegranate margarita .
"it 's clean , quiet and pet friendly ."
i have never felt more offended in my life .
this was done by a gentleman that was of first assistance .
"the waitstaff does their job , but they are n't overly friendly ."
i have heard that this place is really good .
"it 's like just eating oil , they have zero flavor ."
i wish i would have done more research .
"the calamari was breaded and fried and had no seasoning , including salt ."
i have traveled here twice for work .
i feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment .
they have great chips and salsa and nachos too .

the staff is phenomenal .
it is up to you how you want your meal to turn out .

the drink prices are very reasonable too .

the food is among the best i 've ever tasted .
i recommend driving down the street to tandoori times instead .

i 've been here twice to try to get takeout .
the fries were also mediocre .

linda at the front desk and rick are great !
i 've purchased a few bags here and the experience is always wonderful .

i was disappointed that the menu was a limited menu because of the event .
his office staff is very kind and extremely quick .
i love the french toast .
"the menu is very creative for sushi , especially the dynamite plate ."
the gyro is dry and off putting .
the margaritas were delicious and strong .
this place is amazing .
"i ordered the stuffed tomato , and husband ordered the bbq pork sandwich ."
"never got an apology from him , nothing ."
i walked that store twice looking to see if i missed something .
this is the best place to eat breakfast in the valley hands down .
honestly i was a little disappointed before i even sat down for dinner .
i 'm sad that i wasted my money .
this place is not that great .
love the pork green chile but it is super rich and best to share .
my dog was not given the care he needed .
thank you for always helping me to look my best .
the tow package is not an issue either .
that is seriously irritating .
this urgent care doesnt even deserve _num_ star !
i did gave two starts because the people are very courteous .
"how he missed it , i 'll never know ."
"unfortunately , my experience with the staff leaves much to be desired ."

the staff is incredible .
small wonder he has such a loyal following .
it is one of the worst i 've been to .
they were out of the signature osso buco .
i love the enchilada sauce .
this location has serious wait staff issues .
dry and a bit stale bread and the gyro meat was dry .
"`` , i thought , she just forgot to take it off ."
they were honest and forthright .
there is no tv in the bedroom either .
the owner and manager are absolutely obnoxious .
some time is reasonable but over thirty minutes for eggs ?
i really do n't get it .

i enjoy the small hometown feel of the restaurant .
family owned and run !
service here is slow .
"ordered the thai pad , it was mushy and so tasteless ."
"wow , this place is incredible ."
the food and the ambience is special .

the pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland .
the best part about this place is cardinals baseball is played here .
everything is amazing and so fresh here .

the service is bad and the landscaping is dangerous .
it gets busy and the service is horribly slow .
this place is definitely a new favorite !

the steak fajitas were great along with the half pitcher of margarita .

the service we had was exceptional .
it has a south pacific theme .
"great patio , dining room is cool too ."
we also got a large pepperoni pizza which came out nice and hot !
"he was n't , trust me , i was a server for years ."
it is a place where you can sit back and enjoy your ice cream .
the patio has great views especially at sunset .
service is horrible .
this standing up for 2-3 hours to see a concert is crap !
i love the amenities they offer as well as the spacious floor plans !

i love to take my company on a dolly steamboat cruise .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .

the pepper steak is really overly sauced up but not too bad .
this locations sucks .
"to make matters worse , we were `` checked '' as we left early ."
green flannel is incredible and so is the jalapeno pecan pancakes .
the wings are small and not worth the money .

"the food is a bit pricey , but the portions are very generous ."
towing is beyond reliable and fast .
both are great .
i guess anyone who has to go to work is just out of luck .
this place is amazing !
"it was a bit expensive , but it was worth it ."
"however , beef was very tender , but not impressed ."
both are amazing !
consider yourself warned .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
so i found this place on main st .
the services was unfriendly to say the least .
anyway i informed about the same myself .
the pie for desert was okay .
another mid age white guy later on sat _num_ seats away from me .
i enjoyed this gyro restaurant and will visit again !
was told to wait by clerk passing on phone .
"however , he failed to understand and was rude ."
the family that owns this place are the sweetest .
"every employee was kind , helpful , and most importantly not pushy ."
the fries were unremarkable .
we were able to talk and hear each other easily .
"it is a pretty small place , but has a really good atmosphere ."
"she is always booked , so make sure you book ahead of time !"
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful .
the staff and service are _num_ star as well !
"but the burgers are good , and the fries ."
they had no record of having towed my car .
come here if you want an honest and hard working business .
you 've been warned .
"i went to them to correct the bill , which they realized the mistake ."
so my wife and i had tickets to the 10pm show this past saturday .
the service was really fast and pleasant .
happy hour deals looked good as well .
"he said yes , but would need another _num_ business days to complete ."
"insurance last billed on may _num_ , _num_ . ''"
"besides the food tasting delicious , the service was really good ."
he is such a rude jerk .
"this time the woman , was extremely rude ."
the fries were just fine but the steak was pitiful .
everything we have ordered off the menu has been great .
i was recommended here by a friend from phoenix .
i 'm so happy .
you lost a another few customers today at your location .
food was seasoned perfectly and the giant plate had a nice variety of foods .
however that is where all the good ends .
it was a horrible experience .
"also you can bring in food and snacks , at least we did ."
"forever for the check , which was not worth the price ."
the food here is very good .
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
how the hell does a staple end up in an appetizer ?
i highly recommend this restaurant .
the price out on the sign for gas is the cash price .
they do n't want your money .
the appetizer was wonderful .
and this place is ridiculously cute and nostalgic and a perfect date place .
"our server was prompt and cordial , and the food was fantastic ."
it 's not .
waitresses do not know what is on the menu or what beers they have .
the nachos were not really nachos .
i am now changing my opinion .
i really do love this place .
his designs are so exquisite and timeless .
food is outstanding and portion sizes are large .
highly recommend her .
my hair looks beautiful .
the staff was beyond nice .
i made reservations for 6:30pm on a monday night .
place is sliding backwards .
"the doctor was horribly wrong , as the bill was slightly under $ _num_ ."
this was one of the best mexican restaurants we 've been to .
i am so thankful to be out of this place .
they had the best price .
very affordable and they do an awesome job .
my aunt and i love this place !
do n't let few people in the waiting room fool you .
i went here until i realized it was a scam .
my experience here was so disappointing .
the groomers are friendly and are great with our little pups .
"the wait staff is friendly , helpful and very attentive ."
the biltmore does n't even charge these prices .
it 's family owned and they a r e amazing people .
i completely understand how frustrating that can be .
their pizza and salad assortment is fantastic .
the owners run it and make everything fresh daily .
the food is incredible .
"the best deal is the big ass burger , enough for two ."
custom made fresh donuts .
my last trip here was the worst by far .
they have great prices and honest service .
it just was n't a positive experience .
great deals and you never know what you might find .
they still did n't care .
hubby loved the apple strudel .
"everything tasted amazing , but my favorite was the fondue lamb chops ."
then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us .
i had a great experience today as a first time patient .
i was very disappointed with the clinic .
this place is a must go to chill and drink good wine .
this is a sad review for me .
he was prompt and friendly .
the tamale was amazing _num_ the best deal ever !

the flavors were so well blended !
the lines are ridiculous .
worst margarita i 've ever tasted .
the meatball sandwich is incredible !
"love , love , love this place !"
"we got an assortment of sushi , rolls , sashimi , etc ."
i highly recommend minute man cleaners .
"all while this was going on , an old man ( barry himself ? )"
`` you grab their little legs and pull . ''
i do not recommend taking your pet here .
bring your girlfriend there is fun for all .
all while the old man stood guard over the whole affair .
they fell to measure up to my puppy needs once he became ill .
our server had _num_ tables max .
this makes the service very fast .
the chicken appears to be pretty good quality but really soggy .
hitch has been working great .
"my favorite pizza is the buffalo chicken pizza , its amazing !"
i 'm not sure i can return after that discovery .
"the kiddo really enjoyed watching the planes , too ."
"it is old , think shack ."
that was greatly appreciated .
then through each room she introduced me to people .
"there were no other waiting customers , in the waiting area !"
i agree with the previous bad reviews .
it appears the old management has left and started a different restaurant elsewhere .
"i love the food , especially any seafood special they can cook up !"
"seriously , the only thing they got right was the lettuce ."
my favorite is queso with spicy pork .
this restaurant needs new management .
great flavor and really fresh food that 's homemade .
and it tasted like garbage .
everything turned out great !
owner is always on site and is just a super nice guy .
"the food is thoughtful , modern , well balanced ."

the bread was very flavorful and satisfying and the sweet potato ravioli was magnificent .
they are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff .
went here at 8:30 so about _num_ minutes before they closed .
that bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
if i had not would of been over charged over $ _num_ .
"it 's a small , old fashioned shop that is fair and fast ."
this place has really taken a turn in the worst direction .
"which makes the younger people , sub _num_ , feel uncomfortable and not appreciated ."
we were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place .
"do n't give them your business , apparently they do n't need it ."
i highly recommend e & m painting .
i sent my family tonight for dinner .
the hummus was delicious .
"the staff here are always polite , helpful , and fun ."
the new pie was better but somewhat watery .
but yet they made me throw out my gum at the door .
they also have a wide selection of exotic beer for sale .

the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
good food but they do n't book very good bands .
it 's really good with the creamy horseradish .
"the employees here are friendly , professional , and knowledgeable about their products ."
it is one of the prettiest indoor/outdoor wedding venues in the valley .
ray is really making this place a happening place .
it was an enjoyable and tasty breakfast !
the quality done here is amazing .
no wonder there was bad service .
best mexican i 've ever had in scottsdale and papago is perfectly near by !
their craft is a good and reliable as any other family chain .
_num_ ) its close and i did n't feel like driving .
cons : cover charge is ridiculous .

the rest of their food is great too !
and then there 's the happy hour .

i 'm sorry but i must agree with several of the most recent reviews .
the owner offered to provide a no charge maintenance service in the future .
i got the sea bass as an entree and it was great !
the only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food .

i think this food is phenomenal .

cute little free museum in the heart of scottsdale !
i do n't understand why businesses treat their customers that way for delivery .

"we spent six years in southern cali , and about two years in arizona ."
stopped here to get some food real quick .
when we were finally helped i felt like i was wasting her time .
thai pan is yet another new favorite entirely due to yelpers ' recommendations .
any of the mexican breakfast items are delicious .

my boyfriend was fit with a quality suit at a very competitive price .
worst stadium experience i 've had anywhere .

this place just lost _num_ potential clients from not answering their phones .
"first off , it 's not a restaurant ."
"the apartments were great , the location wonderful , and the staff was wonderful ."
it would be nice if there was a nicer waiting area and better lighting .
"strangely , god responded ."
she 's awesome .
eight hours after i ate my take-out from p.f .
they have surprised me every single time - each cake has been absolutely flawless .
always enjoy coming here with my family !
this is my new favorite spot to eat !
it smelt like this establishment had n't been cleaned in months .
this place was fantastic .
we were handed paper menus with food stains and torn edges .
"i asked for a manager , and she too refused to sell them ."
rick is the man !
this was our first dining experience in scottsdale and it was the best pizza !
my fettuccine alfredo was delicious .
i had their beef cubes & it was dry .
i must say this place is pretty good !
i cut my chimichanga in half and take a bite of my food .
plus the place is a real value .
thursday 's and saturday 's are great nights to visit .

this family is a disgrace to the art business .
he is knowledgeable and helpful .
i was really happy with this place .
"so therefore , i am assuming that these people do not exist ."
i 've lived here _num_ weeks and it 's appalling to live here .
have been four times and have had a wonderful experience each time .
if you are looking to walk out transformed this is your place !
margaritas are good .
a crap place passing off the italian food that they serve under normal days .
last week i went in with a new yard project .
would vote lower if the option were available .
it had no flavor or very little sauce .
the salsa is n't so bad either .
the bread they make is warm and fresh .
"the pool looks really gross , would n't suggest going in it ."
after having marginal service we were less than impressed .
i had a milkshake with m & m 's which was amazing as well .
we both agreed our burgers were the best we had ever eaten .
it 's somewhere i must always go when i come into town .
"they discounted our food , not our drinks ."
they truly care .
that alone is enough to not want to make another visit .
the interior is worse .
my husband and i sat on their front patio for happy hour .
do not rent here .
they had a block party that was really cool !
i am truly embarrassed and disappointed .
had to wait a month to get in .
the waitress we had seemed to be unfriendly and we felt rushed .
the prices are fair and they are great about running on time .
cold food and the waitress was absent most the time .
definitely recommend this place .
i 'm a very loyal customer !
"bless his heart , he is an absolute gem !"
my sister took her honda in and was also very happy .

rude and incompetent people work here .
i literally love noble nails .
this is a boutique program serving an elite group of families with young children .
service was very good .
the machaca burrito was super good .
it was beautiful and lined with lady fingers to cover sides .
we have been coming here for years and consistently have a great experience .
the pork lo mien was a disappointment as well .
az tex hats is amazing !
the calzones are fantastic !
the chicken was barely cooked and not seasoned or marinated at all .
salads served with the entree were boring and even the dressing could not help .
service was great but the food was merely good ... not great .
other than that is is like every other mcdonald 's in the us .
whoever orders for health and beauty sucks and should be fired .
thanks cruise america for running our vacation and trying to kill us !
i 'm _num_ % happy with my experience at mark kia .
the food is hot and the serving sizes are huge and good .
this is the best chiropractic office i 've ever been too .
"as we walked in , we were seating pretty quickly ."
"the guac is great , the hot wings are yummy ."
it was a simple battery replacement that turned into a nightmare .
their soft shell crab special is amazing !
we ( me plus _num_ ) get there and they are super busy .
i was hungry so i ate it .
and boy was i happy i did .
i had to take the towel to wipe down my own car .
the food arrived and all our meats were dry and hard .
just enjoyed a wonderful dinner with friends to celebrate a birthday .
the beer was good .
basically it made the event crappy to be treated like that .
the whole job was only an hour just as the quote said .
"furthermore , the mac and cheese was really not good either ."
the food was excellent as was the service .
"it was better than good , it was awesome !"
every time i have found the food to be mediocre .
he was super helpful and informative .
the ugly : the waitresses were the worst i 've encountered in az .
the rice was as dry as the desert .
maybe it is better just to go and eat there instead !
it was so gross .
was very disappointed by the customer service .
the whole experience was less than savory .
"the food was good , but the customer service was horrible ."
the atmosphere was nice and our server was very friendly .
i then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles .
the people who work there are exceedingly nice and helpful .
this is legit as it gets .
you really do feel like you 're in mexico !

any duck menu item is always one of my favorites !
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
thank you guys so much .
i had been consistently coming here near weekly for a few years .
a treasure hunt where you are almost sure to find a treasure .
i just left as soon as i could .
its clean and well respected and the dr 's have a great team .
it was a hit .

", cuz this one 's made the do n't believe the hype list ."
it is the one thing i will always do when visiting phoenix .
it was packed with trivia people !
i walked out after _num_ minutes waiting for a chicken sandwich .
by now we have n't even gone in for 2-3 weeks now .
the owner mike is very nice and knowledgeable about all of his inventory .
my baby loves going to `` school '' every day !
this place is super yummy !
the pizza however was amazing !
i stop at mcdonalds perhaps three times a year .
the restaurant is old and outdated inside .
courtyard marriott north always delivers a quality room with over the top service .
"but like the garlic knots , the dough itself offered very little flavor ."
wish we had ordered the french toast because it did look very good .
"once i find something i like , i stick with it ."
i highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a good haircut .
the food is just that good .
prices are reasonable and the staff is awesome !
do not waste your money or your time here .
but they do n't have any ideas for nail art .
heidi is always fun to visit with !
she is great .
there was obviously an issue that needed to be fixed .
it works out to be a great value .
now do n't even get me started about the pool area !
it was amazing !
i left hungry after ordering _num_ courses and sending the main entre back .
i enjoyed the halibut along with garlic mashed potatoes ( plenty to share ) !
"ok , i am a big breakfast fan , trust me ."
for the other in my group it was just too much .
extra $ _num_ is nothing to write about at all .
this kind of place is what makes the valley so special .
this particular occasion was a serious disappointment .
if you are gon na have a drink here you better drive home drunk .
until the past _num_ weeks there were no problems .
"there , fixed it for them ."
"either way , you 're better off at chipotle ."
"unfortunately he was n't friendly , attentive , or patient at all ."
some of the residents are questionable .
"other than that , we did n't see her at all ."
"when i complained to the manager , he made excuses and was disrespectful ."
he did n't have my mt .
"they have the best juke box in town , though ."
"however , recently it is much improved ."
my nails look absolutely wonderful !
the chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same .
the service is excellent .
frustrating because my son 's sports medicine specialist referred us .
"wow , it was great !"
"they were positively mushy inside , and had both hot and cold spots ."
her coloring and cutting is always exactly what i want .
i did not see any reason to go in there .
it was uncomfortable .
i pushed them away and would n't let my husband eat them .
her rates are very reasonable for the high quality product you will receive !
"the food was ok , nothing special ."
staff is rude .
these guys are great .
this was n't it .
this place is awesome !
i know that other people have raved about their $ _num_ beer happy hours .
food is excellent and the experience is unique .
but what we experienced was downright unacceptable .
the music was lovely sounded like louisiana soul singer .
"everything was tasty , and i brought a bunch of stuff home ."
oh how i love this store .
checking back in to make sure people understand how horrible this vendor is .
never have enough registers open so i started going to frys instead .
he is very professional and honest as he always recommends what i truly need .
she was very obviously annoyed by a late table .
"the humus was very light , creamy , and delicious ."

excellent service this go around !
i saved money and got a great education on maintenance and more .
the two times i had seafood with the pasta i got sick .
"at this point , it 's _num_ pm and they close on _num_ pm ."
aside from be super dirty and expensive the staff is rude .
the halibut and ahi was fantastic with very complementary sauces .
great food and prices are reasonable .
it was very flavorful .
i 've always had a good experience coming here and plan to continue .
best quality and highest level of service i have ever experienced .
i love that you can watch the planes take off and all that .
margaritas from pete are the best - dinner in the steakhouse is always extraordinary !

my husband says i need to yelp on my own time !
prices are a little high but they always have coupons out .
their food is consistently good !
many of the guests that were there were getting ready to leave .
the calamari and shrimp appetizers were just average .
had a great meal here prior to a show at the mesa arts center .
the parking is terrible .
salmon is also good and so is the enchilada dish !
i did n't want to know about her personal life or excuses .

hands down one of the best in town .

several employees walked passed us -- so we left .
thank you everyone at az smiles .

"also the meats and cheese were just thin slices , nothing of exceptional quality ."
that concept has apparently not reached scottsdale road .

the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
this is the best spa experience i 've ever had .
"thankfully , i did not think the cheesesteak was that good at all !"

they do n't even offer real japanese wasabi .

we enjoy our occasional lunch here with friends .
"if you are a chinese food junkie like me , try another spot ."
we 're becoming regulars and this is our new go-to pizza joint .

that 's what so great about this place !
the food i thought was too greasy and its definitely not an authentic place .

are n't they all pretty much the same layout with relatively similar menus .
sat down and told the waiter we were only here for one shot .

the regulars that perform are great too .

"now , i 've been trying to get in to see the doctor again ."
"food was really good , fresh ingredients and very well displayed ."

this place is a must must must !
"for some reason , razz and/or his staff does n't know this ."
he went into the back several times and never really offered help .
"my older dog cleared up , but the puppy continued to cough ."
i loved the old school ice cream parlor look .
is she not wanting to deal with me ?
i took a bite and could n't eat anymore .
we were pleasantly surprised with the overall visit .
this is more like a standard motel _num_ that costs 3x the amount .

at one point we received our wine _num_ minutes after the course showed up .
he refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter .

it just does n't seem like they care .

"nice decor , huge wine selection if that 's your thing ."
it was my first time here and i loved it .
this store is not set up very well .
the bakery is usually my favorite part ... or the sushi !
their baked brie and prime rib sliders are amazing !
my favorite is a classic hard salami with provolone .
but their sushi was just not good .
i absolutely love this little hole in the wall .
the guy on the phone said the price was $ _num_ .
there is no reason someone should be told _num_ different prices on one tree .
tried this place for lunch last week .

the food has always been good and the drinks .
it 's clean and the people at the counter are beyond friendly .

"with regard to the pizza , this was just not worth the first bite ."
my sisters and brother are big fans of this place .

my sister just had her wedding here and it was gorgeous .
thank you kelsey for exceeding my expectations for sephora - in any location .
"great service , they know their clients by name , and have good prices !"
did n't even know _num_ drinks we asked for so i ordered a beer .
"they have great service , and awesome food and drink prices ."
they screwed up our order and brought out the wrong thing .
it smells like old people .

"obviously , the beans and rice were eaten ."
"mmmmm , the orange blossom beer is worth the trip every time ."

after all the waiting and drama this place just is n't worth it .
"it is melissa , and she sadly turns out to be the manager ."
vinny the owner is a very sweet guy .
going on a weekday is recommended .
thank you so much !
tiger roll is also good .
"all the while , i am ignored by the wait staff ."
"everyone is friendly , drinks and music are great ."
the chilean sea bass with ravioli was perfect !
i highly recommend them !
obviously nobody is there to take care of this place .
place is nice and quiet .
i highly recommend this bar and grill !
usually short staff and food takes forever to cook .
probably the worst mexican food i have ever had .
"the food is consistently average , but the service is just awful right now ."
he was very patient and sympathetic as i explained my situation .
got the tuscan omelette and added bacon .
had great breakfast here today .
this place is amazing !
the staff is young and energetic .
the staff was nowhere to be found .
"the food was divine , service impeccable ."
my wife loves them too .
their special recipes are delicious !
"i ordered the dark mexican draft beer , which was served way too warm ."
"what more can i say except it is over priced , greasy mexican food !"
come check it out and they have many other services as well !
we are extremely disappointed .
this took me off guard of course .
it just makes everything better !
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
my meal was great .
"twice with family ( they picked the restaurant , once with my fiancee ) ."
my meal was fantastic and a perfect ending to my trip to arizona .
one of the best places to get hot wings and i mean hot !
great lunch specials at $ _num_ this is a good deal .
i threw most of them into the garbage .
the negatives above do n't make it worth the extensive wait for a table .
which is sad because this place has potential .
"nice and friendly service , and the food is great ."
this is my favorite restaurant in the valley .
"come on , mr. hunan , this is the southwest !"
we like to make it an event and take the light rail !
i am really disappointed with this clinic .
having someone a phone call away for information is a must .
the park is older and a little run down .
"one of them was sent back , the other only partially eaten ."
he continued to feed us until we finally called `` uncle '' !
thank you !
she is really good at doing layers .
i just had a very bad feeling about this place .
"well , that a risk you take when you are a pet owner ."
the waitress asked me if i would like something else .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
loved the selection so i bought _num_ !
we went there with high hopes & but got disappointment .
the environment was great too .
"the pre fix menu is amazing , every course worth the experience ."
wife & i are their biggest fans !
my waitress brought out what turned out to be a sirloin steak .
the staff was great - very friendly and very honest .
_num_ of us ate lunch there yesterday .
"the service is very good , people are friendly ."
tonight though i ordered to go and the food was just as good .
"meatball pizza , put it in your mouth ."
everyone is extremely hospitable and the chips and salsa are great .
this is the second time i have been there with a groupon .
so go for the experience and ambience ... it 's classic and memorable .
the waffles are amazing .
i had about _num_ bites all over my body !
that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway .
she was fun to talk with and very knowledgable .
rotisserie chickens are not fully cooked .
i can honestly say i am so glad we will be moving to az .
i have loved the restaurant since the first time i 've come .
it 's truly a shame that many of my favorite artists play here .
this place is outstanding .
jim is friendly and manages the bar as well as the tables .
wife got the salmon and was very pleased .
the selection is great and the prices are very reasonable .
"when the manager arrived , she told me that she had removed my coffee ."
then he told me i needed to come look for my stuff .
another thing i did n't expect was the great service from the bartender .
the service is always exceptional .
the check-in process is a breeze and the lobby is bright and comfortable .
the service is great .
i went for the first time last night and it was delicious .
"i must day , it was worth the wait ."
"if they questioned anything , he would get incredibly short with them ."
looked like a nice place but did n't want to deal with crappy service .
thank you !
up until recently i ordered take out _num_ times a week .
"very good church , makes me feel right at home ."
i walk a line for him and say see obviously not drunk .
this walmart has a nice selection of guns and ammo .
service is good and of course so are the drinks .
the service by all the staff was top notch !
my experience was frustrating and a poor one .
the place is very clean and the staff is very friendly !
i second that - excellent customer service !
i thought the food was even good here to my surprise !
i drove all the way over there from chandler and it was n't out .
this place does horrible work .
"they were quick , efficient and most important , honest !"
"indeed , there was history in this restaurant and on the walls ."
salsa is outstanding .
the girls were nice but the product was still crap .
"so , you try to tough it out ."
and omg the most delicious italian dishes ive ever eaten !
i do n't recommend brown rd animal clinic to anyone at all .
"the rooms are modern , clean and spacious ."
thought the guy was going to have a heart attack .
and ra sushi is at the bottom of that list .
"it is fresh , tender and delicious ."
rolls were not good and fish did n't taste fresh .
the plate was covered in a mountain of rice and junk .
"not tons more , but what they have is really tasty ."
this place is a little gem .
everything is displayed like it 's a living space .
amazing service and pumpkin pancakes with whip cream that was the bomb !
that was fairly surprising .
it tasted like canned tomato soup .
the office is nice as well .
this just topped off a bad experience for us .
sometimes ordering from across the country leaves you just guessing and unsure .
this is by far my favorite sushi place .
i do have to compliment their scallops .
the food is always fresh and delicious .
i pulled out the tacos and they were full of grease .
shrimp and grits = a solid ten !
thank you for making our trip an excellent one !
food came out within _num_ minutes today and was great as usual .
`` have we offended you ? ''
that part is not their fault .
the owners are great people and role models in my opinion .
but that 's not all to a good margarita .
everything we ordered was just perfect .
the office staff is friendly and it is a comfortable and laid back atmosphere .
it was an ok place .
i apologized and told her that i was unable to eat it .
they 're driving your customers away !
sorry to say we did not .
but it was dead in there .
the rose water ice cream was crazy good !
the staff was very friendly and the food was good .
"when she came back , she seemed pissed and offered me another drink ."
"when we went in to eat , we were treated so well !"
we ordered the banana split and it was great for sharing .
the food was delicious .
i was forced to even give this _num_ star to post a review .
and if you want them grilled its another buck .
this place is great .
besides that i love this place .
i got it here .
the service has always been wonderful .
live music and good wine helped round out our dining experience .
year after year i visit the renaissance festival and love it every single time .
if you forgot my food i 'd probably call and be mad too .
"i just got a take out from here , the beef kabob ."
and even offered me a ride back to work .
"the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated , frozen pizza ."
fabulous service tonight and it was crowded !
the owner is super friendly .
what a relief to know my children actually want to go to school !
i 've went her many times because it is closely located to my home .
this place is not worth the money or craving of sushi .
it ended up taking at least _num_ minutes .
it 's a lot of fun to browse around .
they do great work and deserve community support .
generally the afternoons have the most inexperienced and poorly trained staff .
every time i come to old town scottsdale i have to eat here !
they were extremely slow waiting on us even though the place was empty .
i spent a lot of money and was disappointed with the entertainment .
"the place was clean , service friendly and prompt and the prices were reasonable ."
still had lots of fun watching spring training games here .
the food is mediocre and pricey .
i was there a few weeks ago and gina delivered such great customer service !
they are the best !
every time we come here the food is delicious !
the flavorful and juicy meat was scrumptious .
had a really good experience here .
after waiting everything was cold except the grits .
"but , the real gem was the atmosphere ."
never had any issues ever with all my other dogs at the vet .
our waiter was very funny and was positive .
so i tell the girl something is wrong it wo n't work .
this place is very disappointing .
"i wait a couple more weeks , hear nothing and call again ."
the burgers are exceptional .
"this bugs me more than anything else , even the damage to the vehicles ."
went here as i was in a rush .
the drinks are always great and the staff is always friendly .
even the fitness room was the best i 've ever seen in a hotel .
very unfortunate and we are not likely to return .
and i love their thai iced teas ... .
i regret that decision .
i 've talked the manager before & they act like they do n't care .
they do not stand behind their equipment .
valet broke my window .
"unfortunately , our experience with the food here was poor ."
i ordered a tandoori meal combo and was stupid enough to not check it .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
do your research and not just online as the advertising is misleading !
i love her and the salon .
his prices are good compared to the other places .
he did an amazing job and i 'm so grateful .
for a stupid tanning membership that i 've already paid _num_ months !
the doctor listened and understood my needs and provided me with excellent care .
the fried combo plate is excellent .
"all in all , i 'm happy this place exists ."
my son did n't like the cookie he ordered for dessert .
_num_ weeks later they had n't even started on it .
was extremely happy .
"first , the service is outstanding !"
worse customer service i have seen in a bike shop !
i just quit eating .
there is not such thing as elite service .
was a delight .
salad was forgotten .
the office and exam rooms are clean and airy as well .
our waiter aj was great .
i wish the owners read the reviews and fixed their employee issues .
quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house .
i love this bar !
their burgers are $ _num_ and up and are not that great .
they all looked at me and did nothing .
"each time , the staff has been very friendly , helpful and patient ."
i hate to see this place go under .
the sea bass is amazing !
abby is amazing !
seems pretty high compared to every other thai place .
"especially given the reviews here , i am probably lucky to be turned away ."
all three times was bad .
this response is not acceptable !
the staff is very friendly .
both have a great ambiance .
gets a little crowded but that 's because it 's good .
the workers are so rude .
hope to see them again soon !
i love their chips and salsa .
i stated in the survey exactly what i stated here on yelp .
"the rewards program is great , especially if you 're getting major service done ."
i really want a rug thats not priced .
they have good ready to eat selection and fresh fruit .
it is a must in old town !
this place is packed when football is on .
"so once seated , service was super slow , tap water , really ?"
this is an excellent chinese food restaurant .
"it was friggin ' cold , but it was terrific !"
this is the best place to get bicycle repairs in arizona .
whenever attendants are here they are super nice and helpful .
the keys were all wrong and could not get in .
my hubby loves the cowboy burger .
"i thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever , but no ."
we would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a local spot .
all in all everything was really good though .
"we were all disappointed , but it was n't too big of a deal ."
note : my party of _num_ waited _num_ hour for a table .
"she did , however give me a nice polish on finger and toe nails ."
_num_ diamonds were missing from my band .
are you kidding me ?
i 've tried a few times .
this is bread heaven .
i walked in around _num_ or so and the workers jumped up .
i was disappointed .
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
they truly care about us .
i had a great experience .
the personal service that she gave me and my wedding party was stellar .
not only did she do a great job she was fun to talk to !
"the food quality , portions and the service was excellent ."
the food is pretty good too ... not the best.
"along with the slightly bland miso soup , i was happy with the meal ."
"received a mexican pizza with no sour cream , and a regular taco ."
the caprese salad was pretty good .
there is nothing good about this venue .
the turkey bacon sandwich with lots of their spicy sauce is delicious !
the food on its own gets five stars .
i felt stunning and did n't have a lick of makeup on my face .
came here for dinner and was not disappointed !
the biggest lacking feature is the most important - the rooms .
the server was attentive which was nice .
really busy and everyone seems to be having a good time .
unfortunately it took a turn for the worst and we will never come back .
suzanne and her staff were excellent !
the weather was great and the patio was the place to be .
thank you guys for such an amazing time !
all smooth and the flavors are so good .
watch your wallet here and trust no one who works there .
my food was not hot at all so i had to send it back .
it looked like a store bought hamburger bun with shredded cheese melted on top .
i highly recommend this place .
don 's shop is the best !
first and foremost ; the service sucked .
i do n't have this issue with other subway locations .
had a hop not and did n't even finish it .
the wine selection is grand and the servers are knowledgeable and helpful .
i spent $ _num_ and was promised a full clean in and out .
close to $ _num_ dollars for that was way over priced .
she is very personable and knowledgeable .
we waited over _num_ hrs for our food and never came .
i love the thai crunch salad !
i love this kind of service .
"great selection of items , we all found something we wanted easily ."
the play was dingy and the service was slow with overpriced sugary goodies .
"she made the process super easy , and the flowers turned out great ."
the waitress very rudely asked me to leave .
i always order the general tso chicken and its always soo good .
food was disappointing and so was the service .
if you have n't been here you should definitely check it out .
the arrangements are nice looking and last a lot longer than grocery store flowers .
the food was delicious and the view of the pool area was really nice .
i went yesterday to try on dresses and they had such an amazing selection !
and the restaurant serves rattlesnake !
it 's seamless .
i am so disappointed .
"i also recommend the chicken quesadilla - a little spicy , but fantastic !"
nothing beats a classic sundae and this place does it well !
"the food was way over priced , and not that great ."
they do a great job .
i was left waiting in the store for almost half an hour .
i felt very comfortable and really appreciated the advice and recommendations .
"on top of that , they completely forgot to make my cheese bread ."
hours later my boyfriend and i are sick .
"we left , made sure the manager knew ."
i really liked the one year complementary service that came with the car .
their summer happy hour is great and runs through _num_ pm !
it 's simply one of the best places in town .
"if you are in the area , definitely worth a visit ."
the location is crowded and waiting in line is uncomfortable .
this place is amazing !
i get what i need and i am out bitches !
it was like a home cooked meal and very simple and fresh .
"great friendly service , they make you feel at home ."
we were a party of _num_ and my husband 's entree was delivered incorrectly .
"if you like new york style pie , i highly recommend rush st ."
i 'm in love !
"i left my call back number , again ."
i was very dissapointed .
thank you for always keeping my boy healthy and happy while i 'm away !
sorry but we have no king bed rooms left .
"the burritos , tacos , and nachos are all good here ."
the food is hands down the best in town .
the food was n't greasy and i actually enjoyed it .
and this walgreens is so freaking clean and neat .
for $ _num_ you do n't even get the dryer !
needless to say it wasnt worth $ _num_ and i was pissed .
there breakfast burritos are so good !
the whole experience was awful .
the area dedicated for the buffet area is too small to service their customers .
the asian fusion of traditional calamari was excellent .
i have taken my two dogs here for grooming four or five times .
my dining partner 's omelet was n't anything to brag about either .
and not to mention the place is beautiful !
both were very tasty and prepared very well .
the food was too spicy to enjoy .
i 've been coming here for years and it 's a treat every time .
these guys are fantastic !
"however , it has gotten worse and worse since then ."
staff was very friendly and personable .
all were good .
we went last tuesday night and it was packed but well worth the wait .
the tech was very friendly and professional .
and still got it wrong .
i live in n. scottsdale and the service is always impeccable !
their pizzas are amazing and they have some different toppings .
that 's a rare find in a business .
the bartender pours a strong drink and always has a story to tell .
they have a great variety of dishes and pretty healthy too !
the wife and i go for menudo on sundays it is delicious .
check out time is 10am .
i had a great experience !
the manager apologized and said she would take my meal off of our ticket .
the food was excellent .
tonight 's was far off the mark .
another favorite item of mine is their mozzarella sticks .
it came with two generous scoops of rice and a few fried wonton .
the corn bread is amazing .
the food is amazing .
they have the best margaritas !
the food is excellent and the drinks are amazing !
"so , ended up going to a place called scramble ."
the chips and salsa are also a huge plus !
i got the worst infection from the salon !
the guys are super cool and ready to go the extra mile .
perfect restaurant for any sports fan as the walls are lined with sports memorabilia .
"the texture was just fine , but in the end too much salt ."
highly reccomend this office !
"one of the boys says , `` i think i lost my appetite . ''"
my mom 's soft tacos were strangely served upside down .
i also felt terrible after i ate them .
she is amazing !
"they are quick , polite , and delicious ."
so i got a good deal .
this is not anything close to italian cuisine .
they are always so friendly and helpful !
however they are incompetent and not straight forward .
highly recommend their catering services for parties .
greens hold nicely and put pretty true .
this has been our go to sushi restaurant for the last _num_ years .
"we walked out , could n't find his car and did n't panic ."
the whole place looks dated and not that clean .
we visit scottsdale every year and this is one of our must go places .
thank you !
the entire office is friendly and efficient .
i wish i could give them negative stars .
enjoyed a really nice meal here .
it 's nice to get here after the lunch crowd has come and gone .
overall it was a miserable evening .
the two entrees was nothing special .
i had a great time here .
i felt strange entering this place and it must be the energy of zizzo .
they do that and still give good service to the rest of the bar .
it is a `` speak easy ' with the entrance located in the back .
it 's american food in the worst sense big island meat loaf ?
the entrees are amazing .
the tortillas are extremely tasty .
i would 've taken back if i did n't live _num_ min north .
the veal looked and tasted like duck !
the second day had a veggie scramble that was fantastic .
the owner is a hoot and the facility is very accommodating .
joe 's tires saved the day !
during my visit i had a blast at an epic party .
the unagi was fantastic .
advanced auto found it right away .
there is no way this place deserves five stars !
if there was a negative star .
the vegetables were overcooked and soggy .
never went back .
"it was very tasty , with lots of fresh veggies done the right way ."
"however when you go to pay , you can pay separately ."
i highly recommend getting the special of the night !
"pancakes were n't bad , but like i said earlier , nothing special ."
love love love this store !
i highly recommend them if you want your jewelry done right !
i also like the dark upscale atmosphere - very much like a houston 's .
"just ordered a cheese pizza , extra cheese ."
fiesta burrito is meh .
"the service was pretty bland , nothing special ."
she sounds very cheerful and is very nice .
my first clue should have been when the girl asked `` how spicy ? ''
she is incredible .
it was definitely not worth the price at all .
that 's just ridiculous .
they fixed my car the next morning and the price was great .
i have yet to encounter a starbucks as great as you .
worst wings i have ever had .
we definitely recommend these folks !
the food was really good too and came is pretty large portions .
we enjoyed very much !
they did n't do anything wrong just felt like the walmart of pet hotels .
they just need to be trained better .
service was very good .
the gyros are excellent .
the food is over priced for the size of portion that is received .
the fifth star comes from their great selection of beers .
kia mentioned if brought to them this repair should have cost $ _num_ .
employees are so nice and always willing to help .
"maybe i missed something here , but i was n't impressed ."
"plus , i met one of my best friends during my time here ."
i highly recommend this repair shop and will definitely use them again .
who are visiting from southern california .

our house looks great !
"of course , i love crepes ( so that helps ) ."
the food is fantastic and the service is excellent .
prices are great ... the best part of this place !
"the food is not bad , but it 's so boring ."
that was supposed to be my first course .
"please be advised , the store is not cheap !"
kona grill is always very efficient and always gets our order right .
i returned home and a couple of hours later decided to check the repairs .
we spent hours upon hours cleaning the apartment .
the bread was mediocre .
it 's in a bad location in chandler .
papago is a great place when you 're in the mood for great beer .
the chips were cold and a bit stale .
i used to go here all the time .
"but , let 's face it , life 's too short to be miserable ."
i love the quality of their food and their reasonable prices .
great service and authentic german food tastes sooooo good .
we feel so blessed to have our four children attend christ church school .
great food and the prices are very reasonable .
did not answer the phone on multiple attempts .
"i love dairy queen , and this is my fave location ."
this is not the case at this particular location in the scottsdale fashion square .
the endless shrimp is an amazing value on top of being delish .
went to malee 's thai tonight and it was very good .
he 's worth the drive for me .
"when i arrived at the store , i explained what had happened ."
i really enjoy going to salon tru .
"the atmosphere is cool , but the food stinks ."
rick is very professional and respectful of your home .
even so this is not my complaint about this place .
the family that owns it and runs it are awesome as well .
service is always good and this place is family owned !
i would say in all that the restaurant had maybe _num_ tables tops .
"not appetizing at all , pushed it all to the side ."
this is a `` must go to '' sort of place .
they are always nice to me and thank me for coming in .
i recommend this location to my friends .
the arts center has a lot of potential .
this place is good .
my boyfriend got their french toast which looked great as well !
apparently they have been getting this a lot from midas customers .
the customer service here is awful !
he was both professional and courteous .
this apartment complex is not luxurious in any way .
the acoustics are beyond terrible despite putting in an expensive new system .
this is a classy steak house with an expansive menu .
i love the venue !
what was i thinking ?
"it is a casual place , which suits us just fine ."
it seem that everytime i go in i have to have some major procedure .
"friendly staff , freshly made food ."
the salad bar was pathetic and the soup was mediocre at best .
i highly recommend him if you 're having any issues whatsoever with your feet .
this is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business .
i love this location !
i was vary satisfied with the view .
yuck ... we asked for just regular sourdough and they did n't have any .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
it is always very nice .
damn that green flannel is great .
my girlfriend just loves her flowers every time .
does n't rate one star .
the owner was not available .
tokyo express has my favorite food on earth .
wine selection was also fantastic !
it has a fab golf course and has a beautiful pool .
their website is very good as well .
i had to wait _num_ hours for a tow truck out in mesa .
steak soup is killer !
i ordered the tuna salad which was better than expected .
everything i have tried is great !
i love the tri tip kabob plate with the rice .
he 's more suited to clean the toilets then interact with people .
i just recently moved into town and was lucky to find this place .
my go-to thai order is panang curry .
carne con queso was unique .
service was friendly and the restaraunt was very clean .
this place is good .
not at all what we expected .
i was really impressed with this pep boys .
it 's so underrated .
but i 'm glad some people keep away - it means more for me !
so we stopped going for a while .
the negative is that they close for a good portion of the summer .
"just fyi to the employees , not everyone that comes here is drunk ."
"taps are great , great selection ."
"the dining room could use some updating , service is generally good ."
"the food is good , the patio and new bar are are set-up well ."
prices are also the best in town .
"emily is passionate , patient , and knowledgable ."
these guys are solid .
it 's my favorite ice cream .
the filet that was ordered at the table was fabulous .
thursday night and this place was dead .
they are both a little piece of heaven in your mouth .
i have recommended them to my friends and family .
disappointing is the word that first comes to mind .
"got ta go , i 'm hungry !"
i strongly recommend visiting frank & lupe 's in old town .
i do n't know why it has such high ratings .
she then brought us another four dishes .
service was great at the sushi bar .
"really , is that allowed ?"
i 'm starving but not enough to even finish this sandwich .
the soup was fresh .
"too bad , too , it has a great view ."
"the egg rolls were so good , we ordered another batch lol ."
the care is the best .
this place is the best .
three of our party ended up ordering bottomless sodas to satisfy the minimum .
that 's a nice touch .
i hate this place .
i think this is the step between taco time and an authentic mexican restaurant .
i highly recommend them .
the reviews for this year are not good .
"they do a great job , every single time !"
overall very disappointing for a place that use to be great .
my husband got just a scoop of chocolate and it was equally as good .
that sweet little angel of a waitress made my day !
"pam , molly , and jeremy are especially outstanding !"
"small and quaint , the servers are friendly ."
the edges were so tough i could n't get my plastic fork through it .
the white rice was also dry .
one of the worst meals i 've had .
have been coming here for so long it 's the best .
the eggs are not cooked properly and lack salt .
i 'm _num_ .
really good barbeque and steaks in an old school setting decorated with baseball memorabilia .
so happy we found a new delicious favorite !
third time back here service was horrible .
this was an incredibly entertaining time !
it is my favorite place for sea food .
"i told her this , and _num_ minutes later we received our plates ."
they made nothing about this easy .
"thank you , thank you , thank you ."
we also love ordering from rush street when we watch the ufc fights .
the food did n't strike me as being overly fresh .
she has called every week for the last month and they have no answers .
gravy or onions on schnitzel is recommended .
the manager could care less that we had an awful experience .
i ordered many sides and all the vegetables were bland .
this place is awesome .
my order was wrong and it was way too expensive .
will definitely recommend this place and come back when i come back to phoenix .
so i tried again to just get one donut at around 10am .
the plate is full with unnecessary crispy noodle .
this little gem has awesome sweet treats to curb any ice cream craving !
it is a very clean place .
this place is a definite must !
best curry i 've had since i 've been in az .
but this is unacceptable .
"everything is so stylish , so beautiful , so incredible ."
thank you !
"waited about _num_ minutes , no big deal ."
"very thorough , never a wait , and you can tell they love dogs !"
"first , i walk in and say `` i have an appointment . ''"
everyone is pretty friendly and approachable .
that helps a lot .
i had two bowls .
all the dishes were with curry stains from lunch .
"if they kick you out , you deserve it !"
"really cool , especially since there is n't anything like this where i live ."
that was enough to get our party of five to get up and leave .
we were one of _num_ tables and had to wait _num_ minutes for food .
they use lots of cheese ( which i love ) and fresh ingredients .
it is literally the most beautiful piece of jewelry i have ever seen .
i have been going to grazie on and off for at least _num_ years .
we probably ordered our food about _num_ minutes after we had all been seated .
prices are very reasonable and the service friendly and efficient .
being from back east it 's hard to find good pizza here .
pizza was excellent with a very crunchy and flavorful crust .
but when they came back with the offer it was an absolute insult !
love the fresh squeezed juices and they make a mean cappuccino .
i love trains !
the food was awful - i can make a better steak at home .
the food is delicious !
we came in here last night and had a fantastic time .
no one else was able to sing karaoke due to the long wait time .
"not the best mexican i 've had , but it was n't bad either ."
and the service was poor and rude .
but it started out rocky does n't mean anything because it stayed rocky !
the food was very bland to just awful .
i was n't blown away by the food .
"however , since then , this store appears to have given up ."
i love this place !
i love coach .
this is another one of my favorite places .
the price was also very reasonable .
the concessions are pretty pricy so eat before you go !
it would be nice that the dim lighting was turned up one more notch .
"it 's not on the menu , but they 'll definitely make it ."
"we had an excellent experience with keith and laura , the nurse practitioner ."
boy was this a disappointment .
my friend had to spit out the calamari .
my coffee cup is always kept full and the food is good .
it was ok need some seasoning for sure .
came here to get breakfast and that was the best decision yet .
the super nachos are really tasty too !
the driver was pleasant but the food was cold and the order was wrong .
none of these options were available .
this place is the worst .
"great service , food and drink , thank you uncle bob for this gift !"
his hand rolls and specials are some of the best in town .
i hated it .
"two negative experiences in a row and yes , you lost another customer ."
she is also so sweet and nice to be around .
"rude , inconsiderate owners who have no business dealing with the public ."
michael is a gem .
the food is really good !
he made absolutely no sense .
i love living here !
"um , hello , how is that fair ?"
highly recommend to anyone who appreciates the art of food .

"our meal was excellent , as was our sushi ."
"the staff is always friendly , and eager to help in anyway ."

"the potato , bacon and egg burritos are amazing !"
they are very thorough and explain everything .

my educated guess was that he had been drinking .
he was so pissed off because he knew his hair looked horrible .
i found a full service gas station !
it was so much fun !
"their shrimp cocktail offered large , delicious shrimps ."
she is delightful and great to customers !
"thank you , well worth it !"
the owner of the club also performed and he was fun to watch .
the offices are convenient and very clean and comfortable .
"his staff is courteous , knowledgeable and super friendly ."
atmosphere is great and they have two different bars .
the couple that owns it is super nice .
curry is flavorful and the right amount of heat .
the corn tortillas were sooo dry and chewy .
i was really disappointed by how tough the meat was .
everyone in our party was happy with their meals .
"this place is quick , cute , and simply delicious ."
they escorted us out ... i was respectful .
less than one star - i live here and the staff is terrible .
my wife loves the chopped liver & rye you get to start the meal .
does take a while but it just makes the food taste better !
check it out if you are looking for tasty mexican food and drinks !
it is a mellow setting and very relaxing with unique music .
this is a review for my stay back in july _num_ .
moldy bread was served then replaced .
a crazy combination of ingredients that work so well together .
this place sucks .
and that was the only redeeming quality of the place .
it took them three months to issue me a refund check .
thank you to those who do though .
this was not .
thank you for making our evening so special !
"i 'm from new england , and this place brought me home ."

this place is horrible .
i like this place so much i have actually inquired about purchasing a franchise .
service was horrible !
first time having dinner here and it was delicious !

matt was the best bartender so far !
the green salsa is amazing !
i just left .

i ordered the pesto gnocchi -- delicious !
don is a true professional and he knows his craft .
i love this place !

"it 's also very small indoors , but honestly worth it for the food ."
this place is fun for family 's or a night on the town .
my husband and i had honest air install our new ac unit .
mimi 's cafe has a very comfortable vibe .
it was a fourth grade class field trip .
the best steak i 've had i a long time !
"after finishing the meal , the server returned to drop the bill ."
he says my coolant is low .
how much is good pizza worth ?
the wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly !
"so , here is my review and i give it thumbs up !"
this was my first time and i was very much pleased .
the donuts were pretty good .
talk at work had me checking this place out .
i really love this place .
i had the beef cheesesteak and wow .
the chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery .
this was highly unprofessional ... and annoying .
i was expecting my socks to be knocked off .
"when told to contact the manager , he has n't returned our call ."
no wonder he hardly had customers and they closed down the other two shops .
i lost it .
and that 's something you should n't try to cheap out on .
"we had an awesome filet mignon salad , meatball sliders , and wonderful desserts ."
these guys are great !
i went there on halloween night .
i 'm so glad that she 's here in the valley !
waiters are always pleasant and helpful .
we did n't realize we would have over a hour wait for food .
fresh fruit was also delicious .
this place is good !
quality of food and atmosphere are enough to compensate .
the jukebox is one of the best i have heard in some time .
i typically only leave reviews if my experience is positive .
food is mediocre .
i have always hated you .

my husband and i visited this past weekend for the second time .
perfect pick me up if you are going somewhere after the mall !
i highly recommend marina 's jewelry .
i really like their fettuccine alfredo as well .
no complaints here - zipps is the best !
"each time , the guy took a message and never called me back ."
i still have to wait another few days for the other pair .
prices are very reasonable .
i 'm stoked to have found a reliable shop so close to home !
i got my car towed down the street _num_ blocks .
we had the cornbread appetizer which was wonderful .
prices are fair and the food is great .
this is not what you call service .

"the menu is not entirely unique , but everything seems fresh and home made ."
it made my day !
sushi took _num_ minutes to come out and the drinks took _num_ minutes .
"perfect amount of sauce , chicken and the crust was just right !"

i just moved to scottsdale and ate dinner here ... amazing !

he 's really helped me and my business out by doing so .
everything was so delicious ... .
this place is great !

my green peppercorn calamari and shrimp was amazing .
food was good .
she was also very knowledgable on the entire product line .
service was friendly and classy .
so i tried again and again it did n't work .
i love this town !
she had no idea why it had n't been delivered .
they go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction .
we always have a great experience at cowboy ciao .
shop is small but everyone there really is fantastic .
"i am glad i did , i enjoyed myself and was so relaxed ."
next time i think the courtyard marriott might be in order .
"the owner judy is so sweet too , great service !"
management is friendly and always remember our names .

the service is the worst .
i did n't end up with much .
way to go tempe improv as the joke was on us .
"service , food and drinks were all fantastic ."

service was terrible .
it 's a good place for a mimosa and eggs .
i dunno if i 'll go back or not .
the hawaiian roll was amazing !
it 's all about the food ?
their water was worse then yellow .
"they have mesquite broiled chicken , salads , ribs and other items ."
the salads were even bad .
the ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought .
my husband enjoyed his burger and nothing here to break the bank !
the bed sucked .
even the acoustics were bad .
i highly recommend trying this place out .
it is so yummy !
the spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too .
favorite place for groceries hands down .
the platters are great too .

elsewhere where i got a comparable vehicle for the payment i asked for .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .

i had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce .

"it was pretty dead inside , which we were ok with ."
a diet coke turned into an ice tea and she figured the bill wrong .
everyone is so nice too .
the entire process is friendly and professional .
left with a car that was not what i wanted .
"therefore , instead of two , there were three at the table ."
scottsdale air saved the day !
fries were soggy and everything else was lacking flavor .
the service and food was amazing .
one thing i like is that they always verify everything before showing up .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .

the central air conditioning is terrible .

it 's such a shame .
it was well worth it .
it did .

the trick to getting your lunch in a timely fashion is to call ahead .

they gave me a key to someone 's room !
the english name of this restaurant is an old one .
thanks to him my teeth feel fabulous .
my girlfriend had mongolian chicken with brown rice and a spring roll .

i trimmed away so much bread that had meat nowhere by it .
requested more fry 's we never received .
food is n't bad but nothing to get excited about .
this was the most uncomfortable ultrasound i 've had yet .
come here with a fun group and it 's guaranteed a good time .
bread was burned and sauce tasted like cold tomato soup !
but none was delivered .
there is no better deal when it comes to quality cuts valley wide .
highly recommend the bbq chicken !
the food is good for what you would expect .

"mistakes sometimes happen , excuses should not ."
"it was spicy , and that 's the way i like it !"
"these guys are honest , fair and take there job seriously ."
"however , that 's about where it ends from our experience ."
that was $ _num_ per glass of iced tea .

she clearly showed no concern .
i attempted to return the item the server said they do n't take returns .
they came out and again what a disappointment !
marc is great and honest !
from the very beginning we experienced lackluster service .
"my mom explained , once again , they were not a party ."
and maybe that 's not even a far stretch .
the service is great and extremely quick .
they have great quality meats .
we finally found our az sushi heaven .
parking is good .
the bianco flatbread had hardly any toppings on it .
our server was amazing .
this is a ridiculous fee considering it is almost _num_ days ' rental cost .
he treats his staff just as poorly .
they have good margaritas and the food is greasy and good !
"my compressor was fine , it was a fan motor !"
while the food is decent it certainly wont impress yelpers .
"dont like your job , dont work there !"
we all were seated promptly and had amazing service from our server .
this facility is awful .
she rolled her eyes and walked away .
it is not acceptable .
and then it took over _num_ minutes after we ordered the food to arrive .
this experience really made me appreciate quality chicken wings from just about anywhere else .
i look forward to a stay in the future !
"everything is great , especially the golden medium boneless wings ."
there are many places in south scottsdale that has wonderful food .
the service was impeccable !
meat is soft and tender and the sauce is just perfectly sweet .
it 's consistently good .
soup is good too .
half the restaurant was empty .
but i was left alone for _num_ minutes .
i have nearly _num_ years of customer service .
this place has the real deal and they are very inexpensive .

i recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago .
the staff is super friendly and always happy .

my wife 's moo shu pork was very good also .

"the bagels are always fresh , and the staff is very friendly ."
not like it used to be .
the owner here is always angry and never appreciated business .
suzanne is amazing !
spicy enough it makes my nose run and loads of flavor .
this place is the best .
very disappointed they ran out of average things in the menu .
absolutely loved this tour !
"sales manager lies , and have email to prove it above ."
"bathrooms are filthy , which makes me nervous about food safety ."
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
their prices are very reasonable as well .
my server was outstanding and promptly welcomed me with a fresh pot of coffee .
service was painfully slow .
if that does n't get you hooked the view is stunning .

i recommend this place to everyone who wants quality work done on their car .
the hash brown were buttery and excellent too .

i rolled my window down and yelled at him .
our kids love the butter noodles .
and the owners are so nice !
the chicken in the chicken thai salad was dry and hard .
"first they were very gracious and accommodating , because i messed up big time ."
chips and salsa were excellent too .
there is a wide selection of food and everything is very flavorful .
"they have good art , but horrible customer service ."
food is amazing !
"get there early , it does pack up pretty quickly ."
"customer service is always quick , friendly and helpful ."
that only saved one b.s .
he then went into a hard sales pitch about getting a new tire .

the service was very slow and the waitress was not attentive .
"i have been here before but after tonight , we wo n't be returning ."
"i love how some of the rolls have a local theme , nice touch !"
i went to the biltmore and alas that location was gone .
it was also hard to wash my hair because of the low water pressure .
"or , maybe it 's good that we do n't live closer ."
i do n't know how this place got the reviews it did .
the staff were awesome and extremely helpful !
the server recommended terrific wines and was knowledgeable and attentive .
is there a negative number for review ?
highly recommend the beef cheesesteak and chicken pesto sandwich !
the lack of knowledge from bryan was the worst .
i give the information to jeff and he took it but did nothing .
"also , the beds were horrible !"
charleston 's is first class !
mostly the happy hour menu is limited .
chicken sandwich was inedible .
`` surprisingly good '' as one reviewer wrote !
that did no good .
plus they speak english well enough to understand any questions you may have .
everything else in the buffet was cold .

this starbucks is fantastic !
my friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito ( broccoli ) .
ca n't this conversation wait until you are off work ?
i highly recommend this shop .
"like , just say you dont have what i want and move on ."
i do n't know what happened but this is n't a nail salon .
an employee even insulted me to my face as i walked out the door .
televisions are easy to see .
it is a little strange for a wine bar to be rushing people out .
"yeah , you read that right ... $ _num_ ."
the entire team is fantastic .
my husband and children took me to grazie 's last night for my birthday .
this service is great .

"not impressed , the burritos were small , lukewarm , and sort of bland ."
"when i added the table salsa , it made it worse ."
great get away or great place for a work meeting .

this place rocks .
thank you brakes plus for always taking care of my car .
"lobster is delicious , so is the garlic shrimp !"
i loved the somewhat unique dishes .
i had a horrible experience in the children 's section at this location .

but the family bean curd ( tofu ) dish is perfectly tasteful and spicy .
for being in the middle of nowhere this was definitely worth driving out there !
the menu was so dang dirty i did n't want to touch it !
_num_ week later they charged me $ _num_ for gas .
i 'm trying to walk off on a bill for $ _num_ ?

their french onion soup and new york strip steak are my two favorites .

this review is strictly for relish burger bistro located at resort by golf club .

woman who answers the phone having a bad life .
finally she cut my hair real short !
"the hotel is nice , clean and comfortable ."
chicken lo mein and fried rice was really good .
"having searched for this dress for a long time , i was upset ."
our server had a great personality and always checked up on us .
the customer service in this location is great !
never gave us that chance .
if chances wants to attract a younger crowd they really have to do better .
this scottsdale location is the best one hands down .
i 've become a regular customer of this place .
"so , we get to the appointment thirty minutes early ."
this is my favorite spot in downtown chandler no question .
stephanie is a great sales girl .
it was literally cooler outside when we left than it was in the restaurant .
i was finished with my appointment by 6:00 .
that said the food and service was pretty respectable .
i 'm sure the rest is amazing .
this is the worst little caesars i 've been to .
they also give back a lot to the local community .
"place the order at _num_ , got it at _num_ ."
we ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer and the shrimp were big and fresh .
the servers are personable and friendly .
do not come here if u actually drink anything other than beer .
the main barista ( afternoons ) generally lacks in quality control .
the pizza is pricier than many places but worth every penny .
the server was overly attentive to the point of annoying .
"so , you 're charging us for work that has n't been done ?"
definitely recommend them for a great carwash !
it 's painfully spicy yet delicious .
they absolutely ruined my excitement to go back to college .
"most of the entrees are your typical tex-mex , but still excellent tasting ."
they also have some pretty good local beers on tap and by the bottle .
the food is great and its a good place to drop into .
and their slow songs were boring me .
decided never to visit this place again .
they were never very good .
came back for a check up and hector remembered me .
you are really not helping anyone anymore .
thank you !
"but , im taking away a star for cleanliness ."
we brought our _num_ kiddos for the first time and it was fantastic .
that was overpriced at _num_ and very mediocre .
"if you 're in the area , check it out !"
"my favorite breakfast place around , and their lunch is good too !"
as the name promises it is definitely etc .
"they did n't seem sorry , more relieved because they needed the table ."
smoked beef is the best .
breakfast buffets do not require much in the way of table service .
"i will definitely return , especially when rock lobster is playing ."
the building itself is very nice and clean .

the atmosphere is ok and they have a great patio .
the salsas are wonderful .
for persian food in phoenix this is the best place i have been to .

every recipe has changed from wonderful to pathetic .
3rd or 4th phone call got refund for late delivery .
"also , the food is great !"
not to mention it was _num_ minutes before their posted closing time .
i could just tell that he genuinely loves working with guitars .
they have affordable wedding packages .
i thought the dough however was bland and seemed overworked .
i ca n't really describe the vehicles other than they were absolutely gorgeous .
the staff has been nothing but great !
this is not a food bank or a church .
he then offered me fettuccine & an order of spaghetti & meatballs .
this place sucks in comparison to most .
i was so impressed !
i love the outside seating .
"our waitress was very charming , knowledgeable and helpful ."

he was very friendly and very skilled .
this is one of the worst spots to visit .
the shuttle drops us off and tells us to go inside to register .
this is my favorite restaurant !
i love the chips and salsas .
bandera gets it !
thank you emily !
"it needs a major overhaul , then there is the parking lot ."
this place is a hidden gem .
i guess it does n't take long to cook a rare steak .
got ta love that thick chicago style pizza .
"wow , this place is made for huge groups , not intimate at all !"
morning to have it looked at .
told to go here and loved it .
methinks that i 'd much rather have chips and salsa !
it is very rude and inappropriate .
she is such a delight .
definitely call ahead .
why list was crazy expensive too and not that great .
my food has always tasted great and i 've had no issues with service .
the crust is perfect and so is the sauce .
"seriously , i want it hot ."
"so , maybe that makes us individually spoiled in some way ?"
servers were friendly and attentive .
customer service is fast and very good at this location .
i highly recommend and will use them in the future .
i love the lasagna and pizza .
i 've been a aaa customer for _num_ years in multiple states .
this company is a poor excuse for an hoa .
"thank you european cleaners for wasting my time , money , and patience ."
the hosted threw mad amounts of attitude to my very pregnant friend .
"ps , god save you if you try to play music at the pool ."
"the place is dirty and smells bad , the employees are n't even clean ."
all had that satisfying grease flavor that washed down well with beers .
"i had the beef tacos , rice and beans which was delicious !"
the servers were inattentive the entire stay but were very friendly .
the pieces then fall into the engine which has to be pulled .
"best autozone ever , the employees are always great ."

i got a great price and was handled quickly .
she ended up staying at carson 's children hospital for _num_ days .
these guys are awesome !
i always walk out of the salon more confident with my beautiful hair .
not the first time service has been less than average !
the second star goes to the only thing they are able to get right .
ai n't no way lol .
i am very disappointed as it is a birthday gift from my husband .
it 's just not worth the risk .
robert 's catering made our wedding cake for us .
"lemon chicken -- smelled burnt when i got home , looked burnt as well ."
the others i ate with had food that was pretty mediocre .
a seafood place that does n't serve sourdough ?
the reason for this review though is there amazing customer service .
the servers are very unfriendly .
i always have it delivered and the driver is always very courteous .
i do n't get it .
this place is awesome !
the pho came out a little hotter than room temperature .
i think this manager is very sour about his life .
definitely recommend !
pizza was cooked to perfection and fast !
the hostess was no where to be found .
", i repeat ... do not move in here !"
prices are a tad high but worth it .
the service is attentive .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein and chicken with vegetables .
this place is one of a kind .
"the staff is charming , and the pieces they create are exquisite !"
"i ate here weekly for years , sometimes twice a week ."
i 'm never going here ever again .
the eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny !
hot fudge sundaes were a hit as well !
this woman is amazing .
first time at elements and it did not disappoint .
everything that came out of the kitchen was a work of art & delicious .
"so , the work was not done on time and i was way overcharged ."
i 'm hoping our next dining experience here will be better .
"despite the heat , we had a fantastic time !"
we may become a regular here because of how amazing the service was !
this place is awesome !
thank you !
"he is so honest , hardworking , and has the best prices on everything ."
"instead , he brought a customer 's food ( who just arrived ) ."

the two at front are great ( wish i could remember their names ) .
we all ordered and we all enjoyed so much that we had to share .
i highly recommend this shop !

"20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool ."
i stood there for _num_ minutes .
"anyway , the bill was higher than i expected but that was fine ."
"speaking of pain , the time i had my acrylics done ."
so the owner is waiting on tables .
"obviously you would expect a little exaggeration , but that is misleading _num_ % ."
i 'm new to yelp and this is my first review .
"sat down , was greeted by the waitress immediately and ordered my drink ."
she always does a great job and her prices are very reasonable !
"next , the food was miserable ."
we always get an appetizer and sometimes a dessert .
we love to see it grow .
not sure why this place is rated so highly .
cranky old man who has been in the business too long .
so i am calling the gm tomorrow to get some answers .
this does not deserve to be called a resort .
she tipped another $ _num_ .
i found this using yelp and it did not disappoint .
had a great experience at penske .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
there are no smiles and no customer service .
hostesses who give your table away to the wrong party .
i ca n't tell you how great this place is .
service by waitress ruined the whole experience .
i walk around checking out the stuff even walk by them and nothing !
the hostesses were not professional and the servers were even worse !
this has been my go to nail place since high school !
the guy was annoyed that i even would ask .
weekends are always packed .
john our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing .
"i had steak and eggs , both were over cooked and dry ."
"but alas , even here the restaurant i loved the most was sorely disappointing ."
it 's really a shame .
best medical care i have had .
alright so the reviews here are spot on .
i will not be surprised if elements closes .
definitely the kind of place i enjoy supporting .
"this place is small , locally owned and awesome !"

the size of the helpings is generous and the prices are reasonable .
i took _num_ friends to lunch here today .
cute little sandwich shop .

we decided to still try it and the food was not good at all .
overlooked mahi and wet rice .

when going here for lunch my food was sub-par .
it 's not the best but its consistently pretty good !
food is decent and prices are good .
"atmosphere was great , service was great , margaritas were great ."

this trader joe 's is friendly and offers the same great tj 's products .
you lost big money ; big scottsdale money .
the service at this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
i found it greasy and bland .
no manager came around to apologize during the whole time we were there .
the miso soup was very below average .
she is competent and thorough .
she simply stood there and asked if we were ready yet .
the woman who checked me in wasnt very understanding .
my husband had the buffalo rib eye which was very tender and very flavorful .
they did n't heat up my burrito all the way .
brandon was so obnoxious and defensive and denied getting the order wrong .
service quality have gone down prices have gone up .
it was the most ridiculous display of what not to do as a manager .
pizza margherita had no basil and was very bland and mushy .
homemade tortillas that are very good .
"instead of everyone having water , they replaced one with coke ."
"unfortunately , we were highly disappointed !"
first they bring you garlic bread that is delish !
there 's a game room for kids and kids at heart to play in .
i wanted this place for my wedding more than anything .
i do n't get it .
the guacamole tasted like the powdered instant kind .
it 's always clean regardless of how many kids come and go .
it was a unique dining experience .
i ordered the lunch beef and broccoli and it was very tasty .
cookies had just come out of the oven .
it was very good and felt like a home town cafe .
probably one of the worst hotel experiences i 've ever had .

they do what they are supposed to do and they do it well .

i have always been a huge fan of the sport clips chain !
first of all the service is unmatched .

this is a good place to get fat and poor .
all were delicious .
price was ok.
"all in all , it was a good experience and something different to do ."
best cut i 've had in years .
not sure why this place is still in business .
we had dinner there and loved it !
they do it right all the way down to the lemonade .
the pizza and wings special is delicious .
the food is just plain bad .
"more importantly , my bf is pleased as well !"

"the service was great , too !"
"however , the 2nd night we ordered italian and were very satisfied ."
i highly recommend !
she said _num_ moment and walked into the kitchen .
a bit surprised they do n't make their own pasta .
open seating is a nice perk but the best thing is their wine club .
such random ingredients but the combination is so good it 's almost sinful .
the inside has a nice ambience ; great authentic feel .
"let me start by saying , i did n't pay for my meal ."
it is an experience to just hang around the property .
the food was great as always and the service was immaculate .
the italian beef sandwich was pretty weak .
"she said it was otherwise ok , but had too much ricotta cheese ."
unlike a place like the yard house they always rotate different beers .
"from the time we walked in , it was an issue ."
i was sad when it did n't live up to the hype .
they always have the best prices and quality to offer .
holy crap this place is packed !
"it is not , however , a good mexican restaurant ."
service- this is by far the worst thing about this restaurant .
they were very good .
but who gives a crap ?
everything is always great .
the staff is rude .
i ordered the burger with fries and then noticed it was $ _num_ .
there was very little hollandaise sauce .
thank you for everything !
that is some good ice cream .
i ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items .
they were done on time as promised with quality work .
"they are uneven , and actually painful ."
i am a bit bummed at the wasted food and money .
these guys are fantastic and honest !
i have sent maybe _num_ plates back in my adult life .
look ... i 'm sorry ... but i just do n't get it .
went for drinks and happy hour plates .
i do not see how they are still in business .
it 's a disgrace .
food is great !
it 's a shame .
she did an awesome job making my hair super cute .
so i am taking my business elsewhere .
thank you mark kia !
probably because i ate half my plate and left early .
too bad the food is less than average .
this is my favorite gyro place .
the salsa is some of the best there is .
this was such great food !
"food was ok , bulgogi was a little too sweet ."
"we were there a good _num_ minutes total , and never saw a server ."
this is the worst excuse for portion control ever .
the food is very good both for adults and kids .
"wow , my food and was great !"
"no , it 's worse than that ."
customer service is outstanding .
do n't you just hate being wrong ?
"they have the best coleslaw , coconut shrimp , and ribs ."
i really enjoy this place .
so happy i stumbled upon this place !
"overall , the experience failed to meet expectations ."
the service was absolutely horrible .
our room was updated and very comfortable .
and it was horrible .
i 'm still wondering why the bartender amy is still there .
this place is a good escape in the scottsdale scene .
"so far , this is the best pizza ive had in scottsdale ."
it was a culinary delight !
we drove through and the order was wrong .
this place is good .
"i have recommended her to friends , family and coworkers ."
the space definitely makes up for that .
the beer for $ _num_ was not outrageous .
also loved the braised beef and chili mac and cheese .
"made fresh , like still warm and melt in your mouth fresh ."
"nice patio , fair drinks , overpriced bad bland food ."
if this place was in chicago it would lose business to red lobster !
they offered me a `` discounted '' diamond which i refused .
no other lens rental place charges the price of the lens as a deposit .
rob was an absolute tool when trying to cancel reservation within an hour .
the mushroom sauce was delicious .
are you kidding ?
i was only planning on being there for about _num_ minutes .
you can sit outside and the service was friendly and attentive .
but i 'm not even done yet .
that was it for me ... ... go to taco bell !
"and lets face it , their merchandise is not cheap ."
maybe i 'm just getting old .
family atmosphere is welcoming .
will be going back here for all our team needs .
"firstly , the decor certainly did n't `` wow '' me ."
if this is standard then i should have been told .
fiesta burrito has the best mexican food in south scottsdale !
the service was great and the food was as well .
all were superb .
it was truly awful .
"try one of the specialty margaritas , they are fabulous !"
"i eat here every time i come to town , one of my favorites !"
heidi answers and says ok we will cancel the order for the wings .
the team there is awesome !
server again disappeared in between my husband 's plate being removed and my finishing .
the lunch and dinner items are very good as well .
"i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again ."
it worked wonderfully and the staff was perfectly patient .
ok that was just the tip of the iceberg .
also the two times i have been there the place has smelled like mildew .
the service is always horrible and the sandwiches always take forever .
i love the mexican food here .
we all booked rooms and everyone had a super time .
"it was a nice , unexpected extra ."
they have always been friendly and honest .
the food is consistently good .
the sea bass was dry and felt and tasted like straw .
mike is very knowledgable and friendly .
the person who took the order was not interested nor patient .
the attention to customer satisfactory and the urgency to resolve is refreshing .
the rooms feel more like a motel than anything else .
bar area is decent with a reasonable crowd around happy hour .
they also have a lot of nice things for the men to look at .
"their drinks are so overpriced , even for a comedy club ."
the phoenician really dropped the ball and disappointed .
i always seem to find a new organic treat when i shop there .
so we pay the bill and leave .
i was not impressed in the least with my seating .
california burrito is amazing .
"the on going breeze was refreshing , off setting the night heat ."
i would highly recommend this place if you get a decent price on it .
the food was okay but expensive at least the oj was awesome .
i went there last night with a large party ( _num_ ) .

"their bartender , shelly is world class ."
i love this place !
no entrees excited me and the desserts were extremely strange .
the food was nothing to write home about .
"the food was great , but service ruined the night ."
things are done on date they promise it also .

went to midas to get an oil change .
all of which should have been warning signs of what was to come .
now there are _num_ machines marked out of order !

this place honestly does n't understand the concept of service .
management could care less and say they are doing what is required of them .
"i recommend them to everyone , you will not be disappointed ."

_num_ minutes for _num_ slice of the most common pizza ever served ?

i have stayed here regularly for business for years .

i strongly recommend that you make an appointment with arnold for your hair !
when we arrived the place was packed .
my experience was quite positive all the way around .
some employees there have n't received their benefit packet and/or new hire paperwork !
when i walked in it smelled musty and looked dated .
this place is such a pile of shit .

my first visit to the breakfast club was great !
the pasta is excellent .
is this remotely close to how one should appropriately handle a food safety issue ?
the whole place is well taken care of by the maintenance .
it 's like they could care less about their customers .
it is not worth it .
my family totally loves bahama bucks .
"i speak from experience , waste of money ."
the prices are unreasonable for the portions and quality of food .
"they sell them for the same price , because supposedly they are tested ."
i come here every year for my birthday and always leave extremely happy .
the waitress sucked .
i took my car into this place to get a brake inspection .
our ac and tub both clogged yesterday right after their office closed .

our server doc : ) was professional and attentive .
i got the mongolian beef and my fianc ordered the pad thai .
the menu is somewhat limited but it 's all good .
love the book that was passed out too !
"i 'm sorry to say , nothing was that delicious or memorable ."
"so after doing that , did she finally acknowledge me standing at the counter ?"
"i always get my water here , because it tastes the best by far ."
all the ingredients are fresh and the servings are big .
to find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare .
the third time was not so good .
i feel at ease having them in my home .
i took my _num_ month old puppy here .
this is a awesome coffee shop in downtown mesa !
the facility is beautiful too and the staff is professional .

thanks brenda & staff for all you do !

the guys in the shop are great too .
i expected better service and better food for the money .

they have a very friendly staff and always make you feel welcome !
i was looking forward to a salad and she some mexican food .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
this is my favorite pizza in the valley .
my husband and i tried _num_ different chicken dishes .
apparently they carry seconds and have no customer service .
overall they are very good .
ordered eggs benedict but they had sold out !
service was terrible .
the rice that came with it was soggy - too much water .
our order for shrimp with the paella became squid .
"when i arrived , susan said the shots were required ."
was just completely ignored for fifteen minutes at the men 's sunglasses case .
the wife 's chicken fried trout was also excellent .
my recommendation is to skip this place unless its a last resort .
the only saving grace was that the chopped salad was delicious .
highly recommend this awesome joint !
three entrees and i sampled all of them .
"however , apparently this is their m o ."
dumpy dive vibe as soon as you walk in .
consistently good food and we have always had outstanding service .
they initially told me it would take about _num_ minutes to get it done .
service was friendly and prompt .
rice is not right either .
there was a woman helping a customer at the counter where i was browsing .
"although the food is expensive , the food is definitely worth it ."
this is warmed over food at its worst .
it 's the only possible explanation for this place .
they definitely made me feel special .
now we are greeted with a very smiling morning girl ... at 5am !
"oh , bought wine , um the $ _num_ kind - it was off !"
office staff was extremely nice and caring .
the service was also horrible i asked for a desert menu twice .
"glass , and was mediocre ."
all the food lacked seasoning .
i mean really it is a taco bell .
i have yet to find one better .
strawberry banana smoothie was absolutely delicious as well !
we had dessert & coffee here on valentine 's day .
the meat was tender and delicious .
we had to request menus after having waited for approximately _num_ minutes .

geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
"it 's ok , but beware ."
their bakery is hands down the best .
methinks not .
she 's amazing !
this is one of the best breakfast joints in phoenix .
the crew is fun to chat with and pick on just a little .
the yoga studio and lessons were all fantastic .
not usually a problem but she also kept stopping to talk to her friends .
generally the food is pretty good .
the bad thing is the management and owners do not care .
the people are very friendly and they make me feel welcome .
this place has awful customer service and a bad attitude .
"however , we had my nearly one year old baby with us at dinner ."
& my brother is very happy with his gift .
sorry i tried it .
first time here with family and we loved it !
best french toast i 've ever had hands down .
"so that night , i was really surprised the server got better !"
the man working gave me strange looks and never apologized .
owner was most gracious .
overall i just was n't impressed .
the pastas and meatball sandwiches here are delicious !
he then takes me menu right off my hands .
he never once returned to check on our entree or dessert course .
i was given the wrong phone number for an advisor ( complete accident ) .

"thank you , shannon and rumors !"
i did n't end up ordering dessert because the vibe just was n't comforting .

vegetarian double crust pizza is amazing .
we really like this shop .
even though the food is great .
"it 's a really great , simple place ."

egg roll and crab puff were fantastic also .
the bed was so comfortable .

this place is definitely worth a try !
this place does not even deserve a star .
"excellent , make sure you try the garlic bread ."
are you kidding me ?
"i do n't trust yelp , really losing faith in the reviews ."
upon arrival we followed the instruction and attempted to connect to the house .
now this just makes me mad .
i counted over _num_ people in line waiting for pizza ... pizza !
sorry but not many people have that kind of money just laying around .
the food is consistently good .
she went above and beyond !
tipped the bartender _num_ % on our to go meal and waited forever !
the place is just a great value for all american food .
i highly recommend this hospital and the staff .
this place is an occasional treat for me rather than a habit .

it was bland but overall a good burger .
it is a very beautiful and romantic setting .
the salmon was fantastic .
these people today were truly awful !
we love rosa 's !

the quality of ice cream and toppings you get are great .
"and the staff was okay , if not a little inexperienced ."
the ambience is great - nice and relaxed .
hubby had a _num_ lb .
the tiramisu was probably the worst tiramisu i 've ever had .
speaking of the food here the quality has gone way down .

however everyone was pretty short and rude .
the second location has excellent sandwiches .
the only good thing was the dessert .

they are the best !
"the place looks a little sketchy , but the guys are very friendly ."
this is one of my regular stops .
"he is honest , well priced , and a great guy to work with ."
it landed about _num_ inches from my leg .
"although the parking lot is cramped , the location and atmosphere are pleasant enough ."
the margaritas were also tasted and the churros with ice cream was also outstanding .
i love this place !
they 've added some new items on the menu since my last visit .
the bagels are surely delicious and lunch is just as good .
the salad bar is exceptional as well .
they frequently forget to put the cucumbers in the burrito as well .
just the experience was top notch .
he helped me tremendously and made the experience awesome !
everything was delicious .
unless you dipped in a sauce .
cheese and butter make an awful combo .
he likes to talk about foods that cause cavities .
they just need to get their staff in order .
probably the worst customer service that i have ever experienced .
i am so sad to see this wonderful restaurant closed .
this just shows you how awful this place is .
i do n't even want to give this dump the one star !
service is spotty .
i got delivery .
"the menu is huge , so many items from which to chose ."
i recommend the caprese salad and any of their sandwiches .
"the sauce was very tasty , the meatloaf was tender and not dry ."
"and i had the short ribs , both absolutely delicious ."
everything else though just does n't please the senses nor does the dirty tables .
i had a french dip and it was delicious .
"their staff is rude , their kitchen is slow and their pancakes are overpriced ."
the food is great here !

disappointed in the direction they are going .
the golf course is really nice and fairly priced .
he also has come to our house on short notice several times .
my dog was perfect when he was all done there .
but its the services that makes it great .
their chicken tortilla soup is one of the best i 've ever had .
the restaurants and golf course are excellent too .
i said to make sure they put full synthetic oil not synthetic blend .
they make you feel like part of the family .
and very reasonably priced given how good it is .
and they are lucky to get _num_ star !
i 'm in total shock .
this hotel gets the job done .
enjoyed my birthday pizza !
"food was amazing - a little pricey but , well worth it ."
they carry the best products ( aveda ) .
maintenance is a joke .
these guys are great !
it has so much character and the bartenders are always nice .
the menu is like an upgraded applebees .
the visit cost me $ _num_ .
there are cops here almost every weekend .
"i like the concept of pita jungle , i have just had better ."
he made the overall experience very pleasant .
this is by far the best air conditioning people i 've ever encountered .
"i 've never , ever left a restaurant without my food before ."
they were very entertaining and friendly .
found them to be honest and reasonably priced .
i 'm pretty sure he actually likes people !
"overall , we were pretty unimpressed with this restaurant ."
even the miso soup tasted like dirty salt water .
we love this place !
"my goodness , was she an unpleasant woman !"
house salads were ... house salads .
the employees at this ben bridge location are always so nice .
i am _num_ times worse than when i first starting going to this facility .
thank you !
everything they serve there is wonderful .
the food is always good here .
the food is awesome !
as i left not one person acknowledged my presence .
the best part was the dessert .
"loved our french toast , no we really really loved our french toast ."
it 's a great change from starbucks and einstein 's .
plus the sourdough bread is great too .
"they are extremely fresh , soft , and moist ."
well first it 's not a biscuit .
both the pizza and the sandwiches are simply excellent .
we spent so much money and all our orders were wrong .
lady who works the front is awesome .
the place is a bit hidden but that 's what i liked about it .
"all were excellent - fresh , tasty and well presented ."
we sat at the bar and the bartender was very rude .
we walked in and 1/2 the machines were out of order .
every time i order from them i swear i 'm never going back .
"rude and unprofessional , food actually was very good but the server was not ."
defalco 's has the honor to be my first favorite sandwich shop .
they are always consistent in their food quality .
the rest of it is just cucumber and onions .
chips were ok but salsa was n't .
service was good .
"and given the great places we have reviewed , that is saying a lot ."
"but between the _num_ orders for dinner , we had issues with all _num_ ."
they did n't even know they screwed up until i said something .
ordered the bird omelette and it was great !
it has really helped !
they make you feel like you 're wasting their time .
they treat you like family .
staff is prompt and pleasant .
joined a friend here for lunch and enjoyed everything i ordered .
pork and guacamole is always a great combo .
i go get them elsewhere both times after disappointed .
i had the absolute worst experience at steven paul salon .
"overall , this is a pretty nice joint ."
we had some margaritas - overly sweet and completely forgettable .
atmosphere is nice and there is plenty of parking .
here 's the worst part ... .
i lost out .
the service and the food is always spot-on .
had to wait for service longer than usual .
i refer everyone i can and will continue to do the same .
"really great , authentic food that does n't hurt the wallet ."
"unfortunately , this location has some serious issues ."
unfortunately i hate to write a negative review but i have too .
stay away & do n't waste your money !
"also , chairs are dirty ."
went out and got food and came back .
"however , he stated he would call me back after asking someone else ."
"however , this is fantastic mexican food at a very reasonable price ."
the food is very authentic and tasty just like home .
"basically that we could not get water , and it was _num_ degrees outside !"
the hostess was very welcoming and the service was excellent from start to finish .
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
"i 've eaten here twice , food and service was great ."
so fry 's is amazing !
it was terrible .
in these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way .
and he is very affordable !
"grimaldi 's is the best pizza in phoenix , hands down , no question ."
it was just ok.
service is usually good .
i am so happy to have found this great mechanic .
razz always offers interesting wines and amazing desserts !
the green curry is my favorite .
"then , i did n't pay it no mind ."
"she had a great attitude , and i enjoyed our conversation immensely ."
it ended up costing $ _num_ for _num_ people .
"first of all , they were packed ."
it was very cool dive bar .
but they 're fun and looking for a good time .
"service is excellent , too ."
you 're better off going to ranch market in gilbert .
so glad we got to hear about it .
this one is going into the rotation for sure !
first time to arizona and i fell in love !
great for those of us who are health conscious and on the go .
thank you !

prices are amazing .
the best customer service experience i have ever had .
the bar keeps are very friendly and prompt with service .
this was the worst del taco ever !
the staff are very friendly .
"also , the garlic knots were raw in the middle ."
there was no `` wow moment . ''
i loved this place .
smells nice .
which is a bonus .
"second , the layout on two holes is dangerous ."
bean and cheese burrito and strips are always delicious .
omg loved every bit of being outside .
"all of their staff was nice , courteous and helpful ."
just go somewhere else unless you are desperate for chewy orange chicken .
i really liked their customer service .
"stated they would call when it was in , probably friday ."
why do the seem to disappoint once you 've raved about them ?
it was a most enjoyable experience .
ordered a large cheese pie thin crust and a large new york style crust .
i was wrong !
it felt like too much wasted time .
the service was amazing .
the delivery is quick in the neighborhood and the drivers are always cute .
salsa and chips were the best part .
if you 're in the area id recommend you try this place .
the food was not even remotely close to fresh .
so you do n't want us to sit at your table ?
it was so good !
"see why they cater to bus tours , probably only thing keeping them open !"
the airport shuttle was very useful as well .
if i had paid $ _num_ it would 've been too much .
none to be found till you get inside .
this is the best ny style pizza i have had .
prices are very reasonable .
has _num_ dusty old tv 's outside .
we paid for our salads and drinks and left it was so bad .
"the food was super tasty , abundant , fresh and perfectly spiced ."
the coffee was average and the refills were not given in a timely manner .
was told they did n't have potato wedges .
i 've never had a more terrible customer experience .
actually i do n't really like it .
the front desk staff and vet techs are fabulous to work with .
"service was wonderful , on point ."
the cinnamon rolls are really tasty and the breakfast portions are a nice size .
"however , the lunch specials are a particularly good value ."
"when we went to pick up the cushions , they were wrong ."
it has the best bagels at a great price .
my son always requests it on pizza night !
she shaved the hair off and looked it it for a long time .
this is mine and my husbands favorite date night location .
they did n't even offer to comp us an app .
no we did not .
"much better then , `` this is steve '' ."
"however , we went here sunday and i was sorely disappointed ."
every single time i 've gone the service has been awful .
the chicken sandwich was n't as big as i thought it would be .
i ordered the white flannel and it was so good !
"we had the buffalo chicken pizza , delicious !"
he was rude and it nearly ruined my dining experience .
"clearly , she 's versatile ."
the choices are limited and it is outrageously expensive .
i also got the _num_ g 's cocktail .
the food was not much better .
also they have lot 's of good drinks like diet .
took _num_ days and counting to get a refund .
the service was also quite good .
they are always really quick and super nice !
the wings were cold and super fatty !
"also , the individual pricing convention is lame ."
they have all these crazy little charges for everything you can think of .
the usual ladies are friendly and know the locals and regulars .
the food here sucks .
the lobby is contemporary with plenty of seating and a cute little gift shop .
the one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers .
but the food is different and delicious .
the worst service i have ever had .
this is my go to neighborhood place .
she apologized and offered comps for any upcoming show .
she came across as snooty and rather condescending .
food is amazing .
the service was excellent .
we came here because one of their overpriced boxes apparently failed .
ordered chicken parm and mac and cheese .
"pizza is a little below average , i think ."
make sure grimaldi 's is part of on your regular stops in old town !
place looks like crap .
food was tasty and filling .
"i loved my evening , and even tried the rattlesnake ."
my husband got the bird omelet which i tasted and yuck .
"wontons were mush , and tasted terrible ."
the food is just not good enough for such poor service .
she was the sweetest and helped my mom pick her dress .
the meal was great .
the entire appointment took _num_ minutes .
"i must admit that service every time i dine , is slow at best ."
it was also pretty bland with no flavor .
walked in and loved the ambience .
it is a compete and total disregard to the tenants here .
i really have never experienced a server like that in my life .
they make the right choice of which products they should carry .
go and enjoy - beware game nights are packed !
they typically have a line but always move fast .
i had the james dean sundae .
there are so many better options just a stones throw away .
"so we went , and yes the server was very good looking ."
the store always seems dirty and the produce is always `` ugly '' .
once i even purchased a battery from them and their mobile van service .
"they have amazing pizzas , calzones and seafood ."
they lost my business and my recommendation over $ _num_ .
i asked where i could wait .
"the staff is friendly , and service is pretty quick ."
the sausage was served on a separate plate all alone .
the decorations and lighting are beautiful !
good deals if they have the stuff you like .
the outside grounds are beautifully maintained and look great .
the service was terrible .
tables are always a mess !
i trust them with my cloths .
the food was mediocre at best .
both dishes were outstanding .
this place delivered !
we went there for a late dinner one night and enjoyed ourselves .
this has to be by far one of the worst walgreens ever !
the service was terrible .
the carne adovada was tender and cooked to perfection .
it is like an irish tgi fridays .
she is not .
he 's a professional manager thinking of the customer first good job !
ac went out in _num_ degree heat .
are they doing background checks on these people like they do residents ?
i love the rolls !
"however , my recently visit was n't so satisfying ."
i called and got an appointment with lisa .
i tried their meat lovers pizza in _num_ inch for _num_ on menu .
one of our personal favorites on the menu is the green mary lou .
service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual .
the guacamole was bad .
nothing stands out as far as i am concerned though ... .
food was great !
so who do i call to get my money back .
short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree .
decent appetizer platter ... minus the fact that it was cold .
unfortunately by the time i found out i was miles away .
we are so grateful and the cake looks amazing !
"it all looks good , but again , the price is too high ."
wow this place has gone down hill big time .
their chicken kabobs are delicious and so are their gyros .
it seems like they need more cashiers .
this place is charming .
i have never in my life seen a sushi restaurant charge for wasabi .
this place is truly _num_ star worthy .
"terrible manager ( how he has a job , i do not know ."
i yelped tobacco shop and boy was i in for a treat .
i opened my bag to find zero ranch ... zero sauce .
"as a first timer , this was good for lunch ."
i was not let down at all and will recommend and come back !
she laughed on the phone hearing a white boy order something so spicy .
was the food just sitting out before they brought it over ?
it took over _num_ hours to travel from gilbert .
"absolutely delicious , and it was only $ _num_ or somewhere in that neighborhood ."
the food was delicious !
the staff seemed welcoming and professional .
terri runs the office like a finely tuned machine ... she is great !
had a wonderful experience here last night .
so tonight i tried their new grilled version .
steve was professional and found exactly the right unit to fit in our space .
the cost to install and get a quality unit was cheaper than we expected .
i am not trying to get free stuff .
she does a fantastic job .
it always tastes amazing .
it is a horrible place .
i just walked out .
i am almost embarrassed to show people my new carpet .
"we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath ."
i had the best time here at any bar in scottsdale .
there was also dead roaches and bugs under the stove !
the outdoor dining is area is second to none and the grounds are charming .
that `` bouncer '' is the real racist .
"it 's usually pretty quiet , which i appreciate ."
"unfortunately , i was disappointed with this fish store on several levels ."
she also does great hair extensions !
everything about is terrific .
everyone is nice .
joe 's new york pizza is great .
it served four of us with plenty of vodka to spare .
prices were n't bad either .
since there is no option for zero stars then i 'll choose just _num_ .
"if you want a good , consistent meal then cindy 's is your place ."
she was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average .
i love ulta .
the crew was very friendly and accommodating .
the food is great and reasonably priced .
the employees did n't really seem to care about being there .
thumbs up !
this einstein was a terrible experience .
the service from victoria our server was beyond impeccable .
so they are not wheelchair accessible .
i got a great gyro and a drink for $ _num_ in oldtown .
_num_ minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on .
moe made it exceptionally easy and stress free .
he is not very customer friendly at all !
they did an excellent job !
i love this place !
the food was delicious .
"( no , i do not feel bad about that . )"
if your in the area this is the spot to go to .
"the food , service , and atmosphere are old school good ."
"the prices are fair , and the selection of wine is robust ."
i recommend this place for their selection and their staff .
we started off with the bruschetta and it was different but delicious .
great steaks were had by all and the blt wedge was fantastic .
i was greatly disappointed .
"from what i witnessed , she would n't let her employees take orders ."
we had the most wonderful dinner with the most wonderful service !
it had a good garlic and spice combination .
the service is very bad .
"i wanted to like you , sushi _num_ ."
the only plus was that they thanked us on the way out .
carlos the bartender was real nice .
"hmmm ... nope , it is all of those things !"
this is one of my favorite places in all of phoenix .
you just lost my business .
entire staff is fun and welcoming .
i declined and whatever .
the waiters that said that he could not do that .
also there was not a varied choice of pasta .
"wait staff is great , very efficient and nice people there ."
we moved here a few weeks ago from out of state .
"as i walked in , i was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry ."
how can you mess this one ... well it happened .
it 's to bad that yelp does not offer a minus _num_ star .
i highly recommend living here and the renovations are amazing !
"they use good ingredients , high quality meat , excellent corn tortillas ."
"the service is great , too !"
i love devine 's !
price is great for the service !
i love their sushi and lunch specials .
at this point i 'm really confused .
my friend got it iced and was n't as delicious .
"for the entree , i had the shrimp in lobster sauce ."
you can tell that everything is made fresh .
it does n't simply make me want to walk into this restaurant to eat .
once we got here and realized it was n't it was too late .
"the food was amazing , the service was outstanding , the atmosphere beautiful ."
sales rep knew nothing about the vehicle besides the very obvious .
i arrived and was greeted by the owner juan .
basically was ignored the whole time we stayed .
everyone who served us was having fun .
everyone appeared to genuinely care about our dogs .
and the soup ( forgot its name ) is awesome .
it was over a holiday weekend and the parking lot was practically empty .
the fact that the maids that clean these rooms did n't notice is ridiculous .
"this doctor , staff and hygienist are amazing !"
the pizza is close to inedible .
they were not very friendly about changing it either .
had a great time and bottle service was awesome !
"however , i just had to drop a class because of their slow service ."
this place sucks .
_num_ strikes now with putting things together wrong .
it was a simple request and the customer service was completely horrible .
the salmon and orange chicken were fantastic .
the service is always fast and friendly .
this dish the noodles are literally almost a soup .
however some pretty ladies helped me find it and i enjoyed some great wine .
the price and the quality is excellent .
the staff is wonderful !
i did n't know what to do with them .
my best advice is to call in advance and see what 's going on .
it anyways has been there on weekends .
the food in this restaurant is authentic and of high quality .
i love elmer 's and everyone that works there .
"if you have i kids , i highly recommend taking them here ."

cameron was very attentive .
"every now and then , i have to raise an eyebrow ."
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
"yeah , yeah that 's even better ."
awkward line set up if you just want an ice cream cone .
they 're gon na love it .
this is a beautiful golf course .
it was terrible .
"i tried his steak and that was pretty good too , cooked just right ."
she did that twice and no i did n't really appreciate it .
and the cappuccino was bad .
this is a scottsdale treasure to be savor end and enjoyed .
"he ordered half meatballs and mushrooms , i ordered half cajun chicken and pineapple ."
therefore the quality to price ratio was very low .
this is the only mcdonalds i have been in that does this .
"trevor was charming , polite , and helpful ... an awesome server !"
i love their bagels !
i 'm not even sure it is safe to step foot inside !
the food is above average pub fare .

happy hour is pretty bomb at this place .
i like the coffee and my wife likes the ice tea .
my prime rib is always so good .
we ordered appetizers - nothing special .
loved the food and the services was amazing .
i went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad .
he was so helpful and gave amazing customer service .
she took everything off me and sent me out .
seems like a very trust worthy place .
you know its great when you see a local chef enjoying a meal too .
i sat down with her saying nothing to me of course .
_num_ sides were also excellent .
"service is attentive , friendly and prompt ."
a cold beer is quick to come by .
the chilled pesto shrimp are excellent .
i highly recommend this place to anyone .
this smelled bad !
"he was patient with me , informative and helpful ."
great atmosphere and the food is top notch .
we love the renaissance festival .
wish we knew that they had bar food _num_ yards past the steakhouse .
every time they do n't have the food on the menu .
i love the dark old school atmosphere and tall booths .
thank you for the sincere care .
it was well worth it .
this place is horrible !
order three different flavored cakes and wow they were so good !
"they feature a different special each weekend , and i have tried several ."
"maybe it 's like her coworker said , this is n't a subway ."
this as with all the other hillstone group restaurants are always good .
"they have two to choose from , both are delicious !"
thank you so much for your help !
"this is the real deal , fresh , quality japanese food made properly ."
found this place on yelp on our way home from canyon lake .
it was n't super flavorful and i felt it was a bit too greasy .
i love how they have the in store special meal too !
ordered cajun chicken salad but got the buffalo chicken instead .
"we had chicken marsala , chicken piccata and a pasta dish as well ."
they have a terrific chicken parm sandwich .
customer service is n't really that important to us .
but this was not the case that morning .
there 's nothing better than swimming and looking up at camelback .
never wiped the seats down either !
"oh well , she said it was delicious ."
it 's still the same and still as good .
i had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry .
when i am in the neighborhood i stop in and i am always disappointed .
our experience met all of our expectations .
it 's been _num_ months since his last surgery and is doing awesome !
the waiters are charismatic and i 'm guessing these people have thin skin .
it 's a real treat .
only half of the order was served .
this specific pep boys location meets all of those standards .
the prices are great for what you 're getting .
i got confused .
everything looked so authentic to the time .
hiding the free weights is n't a fun game .
came here for valentines day everything was great .
"very unprofessional , with little to no knowledge of what customer service is ."
they are so nice and really show that they care about your pet .
thank you so much .
she was on the paperwork but had never been there before .
everything about this place is the best .
ive been here twice in _num_ years now i know why .
"bomb is great , superb !"
"the bartender , i think his name was louie , was very friendly ."
bacon wrapped scallops !
i love mexican food & i shall be back !
my dog is suffering .
food was highly average and certainly not worth the wait .
the enchiladas were decent but the beans and rice were great .
macadamia nut crusted chicken .
"well , everything was delicious !"
cleanliness is a high priority here .
they even invited us back !
this place is delicious !
they have mini burritos so i tried two and they were really good .
we were very excited by what was presented online .
we were greeted quickly and sat at a booth .
the food here is `` hit or miss . ''
they have really good breakfast sandwiches and free wifi .
pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic and worth the poor service .
the pools are relaxing and fun to spend time at .
everyone is so warm and friendly at both locations .
so i decided to try a new place !
thank you for a wonderful evening !
they fixed every issue i had and the price is extremely reasonable .
"to top it off , the bartender was slow as shit ."
have been going there for years - always great service .
"needless to say , one star is too many ."
this was on a saturday evening at _num_ pm but this place was dead .
"yes , i came with my girlfriend ."
"i should have grabbed them then , but he had my $ _num_ ."
"no matter what the cause is , i will not return ."
and to top it off everyone is super nice and friendly .
the service sucked again .
the views as everyone else has stated are well worth the visit .
trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare .
it was so good !
i 've been twice and both times i was unimpressed .
none of it was necessary .
sometime they run special is your their facebook friend .
always love this place .
worst sushi ive had in arizona !
pizza kitchen so was n't sure what to expect .
their service is amazing and so are the breadsticks .
this review is for the restaurant .
the green chili was very unremarkable .
"i hate that , how the hell am i supposed to eat this ?"
"although a little confused , we all obliged and waited outside of the restaurant ."
the drinks were incredibly weak .
i had the best experience here yesterday morning .
showed up on time and did n't leave for _num_ minutes .
the staff was nice and the place was clean and quiet .
i would give this place less than _num_ star if it were possible .
"this review is not related to the food , weird i know ."
never smiles and has an attitude problem towards the residents .
we waited another _num_ minutes for our drinks to come out .
worst car buying experience i ever had !
the food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah .
the salsa is so good i want to drink it .
food was really good .
the jumbo shrimp cocktail is definitely jumbo !
always feel like i was treated fairly and received good service .
the restaurant is very clean and well decorated .
"this is a place everyone should try , it really is exceptional ."
ordered a omelet and the waitress asked how do you want your eggs .
the taco meet had amazing flavor .
they were excellent .
i am not sure if they treat everyone this way or just women .
"super authentic , affordable , and the staff was super friendly ."
it 's a rather popular place for lunch .
this is not how you do business .
i did n't get to eat it because my friend ate it all !
there is nothing that could be done better here - top notch !
not long after our food comes .
i enjoyed the visit when we came .
the food was great !
this place is the best always hot and fresh .
i was disappointed when they stopped doing it .
we were not impressed by the food at all .
my water glass was always full .
third - it was loud at night .
my husband and i had such a good time .
"wow , just left this place after a staycation at the westin kierland ."
there are much better french restaurants in phoenix .
we found john to be a very nice guy .
i had the bbq ribs and my daughter had the prime rib .
i had the mussels ... and wow.
thank for making a delicious and great looking cake !
"we took the tour august _num_ , _num_ and bought future tickets ."
they were very good had me excited for the meal to come .
"however , my last visit couple of weeks ago has me warning others ."
nice homey feeling at this family ran business .
happy hours here are the best .
i called and josh made us an appt for the very next day .
"the woman takes my number , and says she 'll have somebody call me ."
food was fresh and amazing and they had very personable service .
it is a hole in the wall kind of place .
sort of looks like he just got out of prison .
it 's good but its not what i consider real sushi or quality sushi .
we just love the feel of a high end persian restaurant .
i liked their own orange blossom the best .
was ill for a few hours .
the inside can use some updating but the place is fine .
they added avocado and asparagus which were a great touch !
the service was excellent .
"great beer , great food , and usually the service is great ."
"still sadly disappointed in this location , i 've never been so let down ."
i had the shredded beef burrito and a cheese crisp .
it was a thursday night and not too busy .
"food was good , hot and tons of it !"
"the food was delicious , and enjoyed by children and adults alike ."
i do not suggest going to this place .
super disappointed with this place as it has potential .
it was a blast !
their red salsa was spicy and addicting .
"i had to box it up even , such a huge portion ."
it was turkey and bread and lettuce and mayo .
i highly recommend dentistry of old town scottsdale !
this place was just really meh .
i am not sure they know what they were talking about .
"man , this pizza was spot on ny style ."
this place is a total scam .
most disgusting pizza i 've ever tasted .
i recommend you try it and i think you will love it too .
i 'm so thankful that lindsay l. recommended this place .
the ice cream here is fairly priced and extremely tasty .
i also like the fact that they have fresh squeezed orange juice .
the staff was warm and friendly .
in fact i love everything i have ever tasted here .
that alone makes it worth the trip !
did i mention the other plumber charged about _num_ % less ?
the coffee is awesome .
this is the worst hotel i have seen here which has this bad service .
"in short , i was told no , no , and no ."
love the biscuits and gravy and the waffles are to die for .
then told me that the room was n't ready yet .
this gas station does not know what customer service is .
"the eggs are good , bacon is great and fresh squeezed juices rock !"
they are very generous with their scoops and have friendly service !
"we ordered a bottle of wine , salad , and a pizza ."
my first experience at keg steakhouse and bar was super disappointing ... .
"unless you go to chandler high , skip this place ."
i was completely impressed with the the selection and sales staff .
overall happy with the experience and was able to get the watch i wanted .
worst walgreens i 've ever been to ( speaking for the pharmacy ) .
i highly recommend king gyro !
it was certainly not how we planned on celebrating our friend 's birthday .
they helped us find the perfect ring and diamond .
we arrived on a sunday for lunch .
not even for the price was it good food .
i love this place .
my date 's burrito was about $ _num_ .
the cocktail came but no bottle as we waited for quite some time .
on a last attempt our card went through .
the bartenders and other staff are great .
i think management really needs to work on their employees customer service skills .
their best meal is the baby back ribs .
i refer all my family and friends to them .
then it went downhill .
that 's just an amazing customer service .
i guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers .
i really like the driving range .
overall the experience and food was a waste of $ _num_ bucks .
the problem came later .
i was also pleasantly surprised by their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake with almond bark .
the actual results were not that bad .
well that was the first bad sign of staying in an outdated hotel .
the views of the valley at night are spectacular .
i had great time .
i ordered the mexican chocolate latte and it was okay .
i was hard pressed to pay full price for three tortillas on my fajitas .
i am very happy .
( took _num_ days to do a simple bumper hood repair . )
waited a year to come back .
this place was pretty great .
that 's not exactly a recipe for a long line .
is zero stars an option ?
beans and rice were sub par and bland as well .
"the staff were all very friendly , helpful and well mannered ."
"to me , that is extraordinary service ."
the pizza is great ... and big .
the carpet is beautiful & really high quality .
some of the best sushi i 've ever had .
liked the set up and had a good vibe .
they also forgot our desert .
the prices they charge are outrageous for what you get .
employees are always rude too .
"the pasta was cooked correctly , but the sauce had a funky taste ."
employees are always rude .
there is nothing that would ever get me to come back to this place .
but my favorite are their calzones !
shea was wonderful !
everything on the menu is really good and the service is phenomenal .
"i 'll admit she is n't inexpensive , but she is worth every penny ."
"that being said , the food here made me ill , literally ."
"the flavors are truly original , unlike anything i have ever tasted ."
i got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito .
i highly recommend going to fiesta when your hungry for quick mexican food .
went there on thursday and ordered something i am very used to ordering .
i do not understand why people like this place .
i went and sat down at the bar and ordered _num_ drinks .
great service and the food was amazing .
first time it took _num_ minutes more than quoted and the pizza was cold !
worst experience i have ever had in my life .
not _num_ mins later they delivered my pizza perfectly hot and tasty !
service was awesome !
both were very delicious !
every other time has been delightful .
there was also a piece of toast which i also did not try .
it had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was so good .
i doubt if i 'll be back .
staff was great !
"however , after numerous bad experiences we have decided to go elsewhere ."
worst experience we have ever had .
bathrooms were super dirty and were n't stocked .
they have good pizza and they deliver !
"but , for $ _num_ an entree ' i expected something better ."
i highly recommend checking this place out .
the bread was soggy when it arrived and the meat inside was cold .
their carpet is nasty .
well cared for tables that play great !
the kids meal comes with a small soft serve cone in vanilla or rootbeer .
she was still very friendly while working very quickly .
will visit it the next time i fly into phoenix !
"it 's a nice pretty cheap steakhouse , i definitely recommend it !"
one of the meals was so overcooked it had to be sent back .
"also , their margaritas are n't anything special ."
service the first night was perfect .
free wifi makes it a great place to get things done too .
"btw , do n't go in the bathrooms , they were really dirty ."
i hate this credit union .
it did not taste fresh .
and the towels were low quality and smaller than any decent hotel should have .
i would say lady but she did n't act like one .
the filet is amazing and the service is exceptional .
they also are the best price in the area .
this is by far my favorite lunch spot in the valley .
cute decor and the owners are friendly and personable .
this was a great experience and very special outing for me and my family .
"the views were so pretty , and the food was really good ."
they use white flour in the rice to keep in from sticking .
it is great to have one with busy lives .
this place is great !
i really really enjoyed my experience here .
eh ... you might not be happy with what they have .
my parents came in town and i decided to take them here .
the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable .
the children love it there and we could n't be happier .
i read some great reviews and checked it out ... .
management is terrible .
worst dentist i have had in my _num_ years of life .
i walked back without the menu .
the office staff gets zero stars .
they are flat but ok .
"great customer service , and my car came out nice and clean ."
we enjoyed the new lunch combos .
"of course , no one reviewed the sushi yet ."
the donuts were great .
keep in mind i only want the one kind of donut .
the employees are always super friendly .
"but for a buck , it 's still a great deal !"
everything is fried ... bland and gross .
whole families came dressed in period costumes .
i recommend the asu devil chicken ... their stir fried veggies are good too .
i was craving it .
it was an outstanding experience !
i have also got some nice jewelry and shoes during this sale .
service was bad and the food was cold .
it 's a monday and it 's not packed at all .
dodge electric has been terrific to work with .
"the next day , we tried the ihop on apache again ."
"next time i 'm in old town , i 'm definitely coming back !"
this store is in a great location .
they also serve some asian cuisine !
"and the bill , with tax , came to ten bucks flat !"
she tells well too bad the delivery driver has left .
they have some amazing food .
empty glasses and no follow up on wtf happened to our order .
description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup .
it is nothing fancy but we 'll worth a visit !
we ordered sour cream on the side and that made it perfect .
the atmosphere was great and clean ( including a nice clean restroom ) .
which made it tolerable .
"this year , we chose cowboy ciao ."
we tip you .
eric was amazing .
this place was absolutely horrible .
i tried the yogurt soda which was disgusting .
"both times we 've been seated quickly , and received our order promptly ."
i went here on a saturday night with a group of _num_ .
"salads , pizzas and pasta were great !"
the emergency vet took great care of him and he survived the brutal attack .
this message is to warning everybody who go here !
"& she asked some questions , while being friendly & honest ."
this place really knows what they are doing .
the problem was with me .
i give it _num_ stars because the cost is low .
which is good value .
i got the combination plate and everything on it was pretty mediocre .
but it 's still delicious and i ca n't wait to go back again .
this place is great .
"as a former starbucks employee , i recommend this location ."
fresh pita bread and the meat was amazing and full of flavor .
this place is great .
you made it a very comfortable shopping experience !
the salad was only lettuce and vinaigrette with a fly .
"fun for all ages if you 're interested in history , and science ."
tiny scottsdale women who barely have a bump ?
the taste of their food is very consistent and the quality is always awesome .
must say it was delicious .
"the nail stylist , erica , was great !"
she is now the happy owner of a gorgeous gown .
i 've never had experienced a walgreens like this .
"it 's not bad , by any means ."
i love this pep boys .
"each time , my miso soup was barely warm , and not very flavorful ."
this is a great little market with big time italian food .

highly recommend him !
"thirty minutes later , my sister still had not been brought back ."
i 'm definitely going back to her in _num_ weeks as she recommended .
everything prepared exactly as we requested and the food was excellent !
the massage therapists are awesome !
best mexican food we 've had in years !
you always get great food .
it was the number and quality of the reviews that brought me here .
my grandparents have been regulars for years and know most of the people there .
the wait staff is lazy and never asks if we need anything .
waiter was good .
"as usual , i went onto to yelp and looked at reviews ."
i hate this .
mike cross is dedicated to his clients !
i highly recommend gyros place !
is n't us complaining a hostess ' cue to get the manager over ?
thank you so much !
i walked in a was seen right away .
it is very clear this business holds itself up to the highest of standards .
you will love them as much as my girlfriend and i do .
food was great .
an added plus - this year we ate at the bar .
does anyone have the number for pizza hut ?
"very , very pricey but worth if you want a small but elegant affair ."
highly recommended ... just dont take our table !
great food and tracy is a great server !
so it is a great choice for small groups or couples .
i love this dentist and his office staff .
the pizza was the equivalent of a bad frozen pie .
the rooms are musty and old with dirty carpet .
todd was our server and he was very nice and patient with us .
the marinated flank steak was delicious with the sweet soy garlic dipping sauce .
"small , quaint and the food is awesome ."
the food was good .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
he went in to clean my teeth and did a horrible job .
it is dirty and lots of walking but it is an amazing experience .
trader joe 's is so much better than whole foods in every way .
highly recommend this spa .
damn all this talk about it makes me want to go now .
best mexican food i 've found in mesa .
overall somehow the dish was bland .
then when the a/c goes on it gets so cold you need a jacket .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
the work was high quality and we drove away very happy .
"the service is a bit slow , but the wait is worth it ."
everyone at the table ordered something different and it was all delicious .
sweet and sour was delicious and he brought me a sprite for free .
beware the dinner salads are big enough to feed two .
food was really good and the portions were huge .
i would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out .
just went last night ... great !
"the coffee was also quite horrible , it tasted like dirty water ."
they did not even comp our meal which had turned into a disaster .
the covered parking next door is certainly an added bonus in the summer .
they were really nice and seem really honest .
"we took our time , enjoyed the food and we never felt rushed ."
the service was very good too .
i 've tried a couple other rather unremarkable dishes too .
everything i have gotten here has been great !
"the pork was ok , not terrible ."
absolute garbage we went to grab a quick dinner the other night .
did i mention that is was crowded ?
the food was filling and made a good start to the day .
"plus , he said the meat was chewy and low quality ."
slightly below room temp is all your getting out of their current appliance .
everything is outstanding .
his prices are very reasonable and he is professional and friendly .
"i 'm sorry , i really wanted to like this place ."
"our server , lisa , was slow ."
they had it almost _num_ yrs .
it 's only good business .
you just lost a customer .
wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced .
i did n't touch it .
"soup , salad , entree and even the deserts are prepared to perfection ."
"i love my cut , have been going for years ."
this morning hubby and i decided to try again .
the food is n't great but it gets you through the day .
maybe if we had been drinking it would have tasted better .
this place sucks stay away .
the upgraded apartments are not actually upgraded they just make it look that way .
"they are both listed as sides , but make a surprisingly great pairing ."
i would recommend this office to anyone who values good customer service !
this already threw me off .
the surgeon said that he would tell the corporation that i was n't happy .
the lamb dish is pretty good but not the best in town .
my two star goes to the terribly unhappy woman that works behind the counter .
two of us had margaritas and they were very good too !
this place is absolutely to die for .
the food here is delicious .
that sucked too .
the tamales were incredibly flavorful .
went to tee pee mexican food who could not have been more accommodating .
thank goodness for brooke at the brow lady !
i love that it 's a consignment store because there 's always something new !
the food here is authentic and consistently delicious .
"but i did n't even get a smile , or even eye contact ."
server was friendly but wait time for food was an hour plus .
our dog feels comfortable there and they treat her very well .
that is one thing that is special to the keg that i love .
wi-fi is not good .
i recently ate at this restaurant and had a horrible experience .
beautiful men 's store that has the best brands with an on-site tailor .
we just found our new mexican joint !
the front staff were horribly rude and unhelpful .
"so the burro was a disappointment , what about the chips and salsa ?"
if they clean the place up it would be pretty good .
went here for a friends wedding and let me tell you.
chips and salsa bar is great .
however the prices are n't that cheap .
said one cook quit and another had a death in the family .
"sometimes we come with a large group , and that 's always fun too ."
she also was short and rude with me .
the hotel was very clean and quite .
had the fish special and it was amazing .
among this list is an alignment sheet saying my car is out of alignment .
the korean bbq was amazing !
"room was cozy , and the beds were comfortable ."
we both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back .
there were cockroaches crawling on the bar top .
excellent service and every dish is flavorful .
once the vehicle was there the inside condition of the vehicle was horrible !
we topped off our own wine glasses every time .
the office staff is very friendly and helpful as well .
sushi was not fresh .
"the portions are great , the food is always good with excellent variety ."
they also do n't take credit or debit which is a huge pain .
just truly was n't satisfied .
service was incredibly slow .
we stopped at the sugar bowl in scottsdale and had a great time .
"this is a great place for a quick , healthy lunch ."
they are honest and give you a fair price for repairs .
"the food came out hot , well prepared ."
their donuts are high quality made and the services are fast .
it is delicious !
the following day i took my jeep into midas for a quick oil change .
the people we were with said their meal was ok but not great .
they have specials which are very good too .
you can really see how this place is ran by pro 's .
he 's an old guy who probably does n't want to be working .
we sat there for nearly _num_ minutes before i was going to say something .
then we had a dish that was a assortment of _num_ stuffed pastas .
not to mention he is very charming and funny .
an amazing production that was just $ _num_ a ticket .
it was gross and a waste of money .
i 'm visiting mesa from los angeles .
food was good ... .
he referred me to a very expensive specialist to fix it .
this is going to be one of my regular lunch locations for sure !
thank you !
loved it .
the atmosphere was really elegant and intimate - great for a date night .
the spa at camelback inn is one of my favorite places in arizona .
best of all they did n't even charge me .
nice crowd and cheap liquor made it a good time .
hope to see you in sephora as a permanent beauty make up artist .
the server also charged us for _num_ salads that she just brought out .
"i had a great experience here , i hope you do too !"
i recommend ordering a variety of plates and sharing everything .
worst applebee 's every .
this place serves excellent pizza and salads .
the room smells bad .
i love this place .
the atmosphere is awful - really dark and heavy in the inside .
i think body solutions is great .
only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning .
they always seem to really appreciate my business when i come in .
he was in a foul mood and took it out on everyone .
"here , they are everywhere and it 's great ."
the food is well worth the wait .
it was a goat patch .
we asked only _num_ questions and were met with curt responses .
the lasagna was pretty tasteless too .
they have some great price points in here modest wine list .
highly recommend the salon .
great place to practice your swing and got good service and good shape course !
the burgers are great .
it was very clean .
"- the course itself was average , the greens average ."
i did n't even understand it .
i really appreciated that .
using their online ordering system is a complete waste of time .
music is pretty loud .
"thank you , shawn , for the great cuts !"
they always have a cheesecake of the month as well !
no other patrons were on the patio ( figures ! )
the italian bread alone is worth the trip .
service was fast and friendly and the prices reasonable .
but the last time i was in and received the worst customer service .
when i picked them up a few days later there were only _num_ .
"they work with various dietary restrictions , make excellent dishes for large groups ."
our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled .
you killed my taste buds .
but something was definitely off .
it tasted closer to tomato sauce with fish sauce than anything else .
it was actually uncomfortable to be stared at while we ate .
both are very delicious .
sorry to be such a snob but truly this food was just okay .
i was here several years ago and it was much better .
thank you dodge electric .
but it 's always great here .
it is just ok .
now that is what i call customer service in its finest !
what we received should not be called mexican food .
this is like a real mom n pop mexican joint .
the bread in the sliders has sometimes been tasty and other times stale .
"good drink menu , too , and hostesses are always friendly !"
the crust had no flavor .
i 've never had such bad food at a restaurant .
their second location in scottsdale is an amazing location and atmosphere .
the sound quality sucks and the shows are expensive .
my entire family gets their clothes dry cleaned here and we absolutely love it !
the bar menu presents a real value during happy hour .
"mind you , this was after business hours and lunch express was closed ."
"wow , this place is good ."
so i purchased all _num_ treatments at that time for $ _num_ .
"great food served with as mile , thanks !"
even the california roll i ordered was really bad .
i highly recommend this office for all your optical needs .
our server was friendly and helpful .
my pedicure looks awesome !
waitstaff was fantastic too .
i know from experience this is a terrible school .
and i love that they are usually playing classical music in the background .
"we came with a groupon , and received the worst service ."
these folks seem to have their act well together .
"so , she said she would put a credit down under my name ."
the food is very yummy .
if you do n't - it 's worth treating yourself !
so grateful for the love we received here .
this is another one !
"it was flat , and had no flavor whatsoever ."
it is just that there are better .
went here in search of a falafel fix .
the staff was n't the friendliest .
i should n't have to get up and ask where my order is .
ordering was very pleasant and easy and they were delivered faster than expected .
the whole experience was amazing !
avoid jade room _num_ or go when it 's not summer !
"if you have a chance to visit this place , definitely do so ."
angela was amazing .
we will use this company again and we are recommending this company to everyone .
avoid this place if you value your guitar .
it definitely caters to college kids -- cheap eats and open past bar closing .
staff and doctor jones are absolutely amazing .
ugh it gets so busy during the peak hours .
food was wonderful !
there is something seriously wrong with this man .
it was the best ever .
this place is amazing !
vito 's is a for sure nice time .
i recomend the strawberry ice cream shakes !
thanks staff at palm glen for making us and our pets feel welcome .
we love going to uncle sal 's .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
the wings are pretty good .
they did a good job .
alcohol is expensive .
the bread is amazing .
so glad it 's so close to my house !
"the chips was stale , had to be sent back ."

servers are always friendly .
"next year , i am not wasting my time on the picnic ."
"anyways , the coffee was sub-par and the waffle was stone cold ."
this is my favorite pizza in az .
my favorite choice is the filet mignon though !
we ordered a chicago style deep dish pizza from here tonight .
"the gold brick dessert was pretty good , but the chocolate was very frozen ."
the worst part was the dirt though .
"the food is great , fresh and tasteful !"
"when i got to my room , my impression immediately changed ."
service was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was mia quite a bit .
i appreciated their honesty .
the mojitos were amazing .
it is very unique and the food is really good .
this place is terrible .
the quality is just not worth the price of the pizza any more .
"so i went to the front desk , asking `` how much longer ?"
i 've ordered from paradise valley florist in the past and was extremely happy .
"it has a great patio , but it 's pretty small inside ."
did we say something wrong or did we look at the waitress wrong ?
sorry to report nice neighborhood place closed .
one gripe i have is that the tables were sticky .
i ask her why she asked and she refuses my reservation !
"after visiting bikram yoga tempe , this studio is not too great ."
as good as it gets .
"the attendant was super friendly , quick , and even washed my windshield ."
she said the description is for a different one that is n't the picture .
"bad treatment , the owner is very rude and the staff are not friendly ."
no one was rushing us so i remembered thinking it was pretty good .
not enough to change my opinion that the establishment is not worth the rating .
if was n't for the view i will not return .
the only mexican thing about this place was the music .
this is always by far my favorite sushi place .
"everything we ate was healthy , filling and delicious ."
"on a side note , this place used to be crowded ."
we waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got _num_ .

nice background music and fast service buy they do n't rush you .

the staff knows there stuff !
price : way too expensive for what you get .
thats what i have to say about scottsdale lanes this saturday morning .
brandon is such a sweetheart !
"even for family style plates , i think it 's slightly overpriced ."

"they make their own fresh bread , and use quality meats and cheeses ."
patio in the back has a great atmosphere .
i slept amazing and had no noisy neighbors .

"full service , they even offer massages !"
the food is amazing and all of the staff are really nice !

they really went above and beyond and make you feel very special .
there are not enough tables for the amount of people .
shrimp enchiladas was not up to par .
my chicken was cold and i asked for vinaigrette not cesar dressing .
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
the big sign out front says $ _num_ .
he is an a hole .
"quality control needs work at this place , we wont be going back ."

the place was very clean and i liked the artwork and decor .

roaring fork is not perfect but it is pretty close .
there are only _num_ locations in the valley so hope you live close .

"rick is very professional , honest , knowledgeable and quick ."
all in all i really enjoyed the coach house .
i love it .
the main entrance is very cute too .
baked ravioli was outstanding .
play area was ridiculously hot seems like ac was n't working .
this has to be one of the worst .
the customer service was also amazing ; diane went above and beyond .
it 's magic .
the oatmeal we ordered had no taste .
their customer service is awful as well they do n't help .
literally nothing here seemed clean .
the service was fine .
and the guy was so rude .
they are consistantly friendly and efficient .
manager was there but did n't seem to care .
made sure i was completely satisfied !
not a fan of the food but maybe i went on an off night .
store policy is not to send cash through the mail .
myself and family / friends have been going to them for years !
it just looks a little run down .
i ate ghost chili peppers and it did not hurt this bad .
everything was good .
the seasoning was off and it tasted like dry grilled beef .
check was _num_ off .

sauce was spicy and unlike any steak i was ever served .
they service both my car and my wife 's .
i 'm sorry .

i highly recommend even a drink at the bar at sunset !
the ambience and location are fantastic .
food was delicious .
they were great !
drinks were nasty !
i was dragged here and was not interested ... .
everything about this experience was what great customer service and great food should be .
go to another dentist if you want to be taken care of properly .
"so heavy on quinoa content , it overwhelmed everything else ."
if you have a membership trip another la fitness .
we 've mostly ordered the specials and have loved everything we 've eaten .
"because of that , i hired them to install my new dishwasher , ."
follow up with the gm has not been pleasant either .
it 's outdated like its food .
the change machine was out of quarters .
they installed a light above my pool table and did an excellent job .
and then there is n't even an apology .
to add insult to injury the whole meal was swimming .
"however , after eating here for some time i had to stop ."
i really enjoyed my experience there .
this piece of cardboard was n't worth more than $ _num_ .
i am so pleased with his professionalism and fast service .
they are very kind to wine drinkers as well .
i finally ate dinner here and it 's official : i am a fan !
their food is out of this world ; same goes for their wonderful coffee .

they were rude to each other and to the customers .
very good mongolian bbq especially given the area it 's in .
the staff was great .
i was thoroughly impressed .
it was highly recommended by the concierge of the hotel where we stayed .
this is the worst cleaner i have ever visited .
it was my gf bday and she made sure we had a great experience .
waited _num_ minutes for my food .
and it does it 's job .
their vegas margarita ( not on the menu ) is pretty good too !
"i ask for ice chips , sorry not until we get ct results ."
you 're wasting my time .
we walked out .
it 's your typical divey hipster bar inside but the beer selection quite sophisticated .
it was bizarre .
"our appetizers ( crab cakes and steamed mussels ) were great , as usual ."
it made for the perfect night out in old town scottsdale .
that 's ridiculous .
the food at the grotto is exceptional ... hence almost _num_ years of business .
the menu is varied and creative .
by far the best tasting home made mexican food in the valley .
awesome considering she thought the work had just ended .
the tables in the front are a little crowded .
this location is absolutely top notch .
the christmas decorations is just an added bonus during the holiday season !
the salad itself was a real let down .
the only thing that was good was the sip of mimosa i had .
none of the other stylists said anything ... do i walked out .
"service was fast , friendly and professional ."
i love that it is a pet friendly complex !
the service has always been excellent and the staff very friendly .
food and service is wonderful !
"also , it made my tummy hurt ."

it 's such a clean place and the staff is really friendly !
worst office support i have ever encountered
nordstrom this has been a trend for you .
salads are great and so is service .
"this is , as usual , a great nursery ."
but everything tasted great and the service was quick and friendly .
nothing was horrible .
"overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much ."
highly recommend this shop .
best pizza i have eaten in years .
the whole family loves this place .
the spa is extremely dated and the staff is average .
honest air installed a new a/c unit for us last spring .
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
they did n't seem to be to busy .
the best italian we 've found in mesa yet .
the staff is very friendly here .
the food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating !
also we had n't even gotten our check yet !
they are creative signature items and also every customer can make their own .
the car was not cleaned well .
they also do free tire checks and will maintain the air pressure for you .
the bathrooms were just disgusting .
it all went downhill from there .
i was very sure to say `` add _num_ % ! ''
besides all this their prices are n't the best around .
my corned beef has was perfect and i ate all of it !
important to note this restaurant has changed ownership a few months ago .
i do not smoke .
the food was pretty good and the prices were reasonable .
"but every week , they have great deals on something !"
i 'm very glad with the customer service i received throughout my visit .
the food was delicious and definitely worth visiting and coming back for .
food and service was excellent .
i agree with everything nicole n. so beautifully stated .
it is truly refreshing to see a smaller shop constantly be so busy .
all you get here is cheap cheap cheap for pretty expensive rolls and drinks .
the next time i am in the area i will definitely come back again .
i highly recommend it !
"it was as spicy as i ordered it , but somehow tasteless ."
overall it 's a nice neighborhood pub .
the service was great .
i am sorry but i wo n't come back .
he will explain his treatment plan and you take it from there .
thought we were in tempe not south phoenix ... its really sad too .
"friday comes around , _num_ am ."
the carne asada burrito is awesome !
i have been going here about _num_ years and they always exceed my expectations .
i also almost had my car towed for parking in my spot .
the worst ( in every way ) restaurant i have ever been to .
the owner was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful .
she 's always so helpful !
the shrimps are always cooked to a perfect texture .
the town itself is really sad .
i was pleased with his service .
room spacious and room super clean i was impressed !
it was getting so late on a saturday night that i almost fell asleep .
she says sorry but thanks for coming .
it makes it much easier to keep my mouth healthy .
"i love this place , the service is always great !"
even the cooks in the back are friendly .
hubs had pork that was fatty and bland .
slightly pricey but i never mind paying it because it 's worth it .
"service comes quick , and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great !"
i also like the gift shop .
"i do n't recommend the wing bar , not worth it ."
they decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business .
i 've tried a lot of dishes here too .
each game is two coins which is too much if you ask me .
the food was excellent !
i love the seasoned salt fries .
the staff was extremely friendly and the service was great .
we all ordered the chicken pad thai which was boring and bland .
next time i 'm in scottsdale i 'll definitely be in to thank her .
on top of that when they did locate my jewelry it was damaged .
they feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish .
they love it and it is always such a huge portion .
he also had the steak and really enjoyed that .
they are easy to get an appointment with and the doctors are very thorough .
it is no big deal .
the last bill was just under $ _num_ .
grilled sausage & veggie skewers are excellent .
it 's a must try if you enjoy pizza !
they brought my little pup a water bowl while we enjoyed our meal .
it was delicious !
nice gesture but the bread was greasy and flavorless .
my child goes to see a doctor here .
the worse place that i have done in the last _num_ years .
good to see that they have fresh juices .
they probably have good fried food but anything else is just not good .
the staff is great and many have been there for many years .
beat every other company significantly .
i recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans .
"they claim they accept insurance , then they do n't ."
now my dog has pain medication and can not move his neck .
( there were _num_ patrons sitting at the bar ) .
service here is always great .
chips are also good .
owners are great but the food is very bland and average at best .
defalco 's italian grocery has the best of the best !
the cannolis are pretty much perfect .
you ca n't beat the price and the guys that work here are honest !
this place is a perfect mix of everyday and exotic .
pizza was great .
i love this place .
here is where stuff gets bad .
food was decent and reasonably priced .
the rest of our meal did n't get much better .
a burger is $ _num_ .
the owner is awesome with a great sense of humor .
our service was wonderful .
grimaldi 's was an excellent experience .
she let me know that it would be about _num_ minutes to an hour .
the same time i bought the sausages i also purchased meatballs .
diane fit me in on a saturday morning and the result speaks for itself !
so we stopped going to this qt .
"bought a _num_ kia soul , horrible gas mileage i must say ."
my husband ordered a medium rare steak that came very rare .
dining there is always tasty .
enjoyed our lunch here today .
i thought the food was lousy .
this was not a good experience .
i love a good buffet !
"it was delicious going down , but i regretted it the next day !"
the service was excellent as well .
"the drinks are cheap , the service is good ."
we have found a great place !
"it was all right , nothing to write home about ."
"it 's tangy , it 's sweet , it 's just awesome !"
"and yes , the bathrooms are as disgusting as other reviewers have mentioned ."
i 'm giving macayos money ... not the other way around .
"they also have super accessible specials to make a truly happy , happy hour !"
this place is great .
but the rooms are not so nice .
the owner treated us like family and really felt like we were back home .
eggs were n't mixed in they were on the side .
the artists showing their work are authentic and edgy .
"then , we ordered our food and waited another _num_ minutes ."
"listen , if i 'm paying i can be picky ."
the appetizers were wonderful .
lynn needs to go flip burgers for a living !
food is really good if you like spicy .
all were excellent .
great people make great flower arrangements !
"i almost think it 's a race thing , i 'm white ."
"located at sanctuary camelback mountain resort & spa , this is a beautiful place ."
it was not as severe as the _num_ tooth opposite side .
as we walked away he said it was an honest mistake .
the manager is a dishonest dealer .
"it 's a type of tzatziki sauce , but it tastes different ."
i told him they were very important too .
"a couple in particular were super nice , hence _num_ stars and not _num_ ."
"but , i 've been going there for years and years and years ."
hope i get even better experience this time .
this place is a most see must do during xmas time !
the crispy fried duck was delicious when coupled with the spicy sauce .
cooked to perfection everything from beginning to end was delicious .
"purchased sat tickets , great experience as always ."
the prices are great .
i highly recommend this shop to anyone .
absolutely loved this place .
the server seemed irritated and very inattentive .
"the staff is excellent , attentive and pleasant ."
these guys were amazing .
i am actually really sad .
are you kidding me ?
thank you residence inn scottsdale for a wonderful stay !
the atmosphere was very nice as was the staff .
suffice to say it was disappointing .
my whole family likes it !
"by the way , the tea was never delivered ."
"that 's where it ends , though ."
they were really friendly and really knowledgeable .
this is a perfect place to go with friends .
"they are the most moist , soft , delicious things in the world ."
"i will never , i repeat never visit this establishment again ."
the food is even better !
"so unfortunately , my first experience was not so good ."
had the artichoke hearts as an appetizer and it was great .
"equipment is in decent shape , but it is rather crowded ."
it felt nice to walk into a dive bar to watch the show .
turns out it has an expiration date within _num_ days .
the room was spacious but no way worth the price .
my dad got a gift card and took us .
we have been going to sweet cakes for years .
will definitely come back when we want a nice steak place !
just terrible is all i can say .
pools are yellow and dirty all the time .
it 's probably enough for most people to share or take home .
"the crowds is always eclectic , energetic , and typical for scottsdale ."
have stayed at a number of the top locations in scottsdale .
i barely lived in this apartment .
i recommend scottsdale smile center to anyone looking for a dentist .
this place serves no real educational purpose .
i thought that was so awesome !
prices are reasonable and the food is good .
"the coffee is great , and the large orange juice is just awesome ."
just had to get these things off my chest .
the food is what i love over the beer .
i highly recommend the banana nut pancakes !
"salsa is unique and has great kick , served with homemade chips ."

at this point i gave up .
the bartenders are great and they make great drinks !

my wife ordered one with machaca that she loved as well .
but this place is awesome !
the service was also wonderful .

"outstanding work , and the service is second to none ."
i am a mac user and so are a million other people .

they need to lay off the ice .
first off this restaurant is dirty .

its ironic that the most convenient gym in phoenix is the worst .
they 've been training new employees and everyone is kind and fast .

supposed to be _num_ minutes long and she ended _num_ minutes early .
unfortunately we waited over an hour for food that never showed up .
so i 've had to cancel my appointment yet again .
"i 'm sorry my friend , you should have told us ."
tons of regular customers which tells you it 's good .
they get creative with there rolls and specials .
you feel exclusive in small space which is a turn on to most .

the billing department is a complete rip off .
service was n't that great either .
the woman doing my nails ( loan ) was very nice and professional .
i 'm really bummed to have a negative attitude about this place .
the staff here did their jobs & kept us happy during our week stay .

my dog was not walking pretty much at all .
my wife and i love this place !
the live music is awesome as well .
i love pizza so much i can eat an entire large pizza by myself .

this is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats .
seems to be the trend at most fast food places now a days .
"past experiences were good but after this one , we will not return ."
did n't know i was going to an international airport .
"it 's huge , and delicious ."
every experience i 've had here has been fantastic .

their homemade bbq chips are awesome too !
but the customer service and pizza were better than most .
food was amazing .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
he is so funny .
i hate jamba attitude .

but she gave me the push i needed to find something better .
this place is great .
"so we ask to have no olives , add tomatoes instead ) ."
thanks for all you do helen !

the worst resort i have ever stayed out .
both were tiny and overcooked .
the art is also affordable enough that regular people are able to buy it .
it was gross !
the manicure was clean and enjoyable !
he did n't listen to me and set up an appt for weight loss .
you get so much for the price and the food is fresh and delicious .

food sounds great but tastes quite bland .
i recently visited while searching for a venue for a commitment ceremony and reception .
"the service was excellent , the menu was very unique ."
its a great place to start with your friends before you hit the clubs .
the food is as bad as all the reviews here say .
jenny is the best and can work with any hair type or color .
everything in the deli is top quality .
always kept clean and maintained .
_num_ stars was only given for food .
they are always great .
"everything was great the outside patio the drinks , service and food !"

the food is amazing .
the hash is awesome but our favorite part is the mexican coffee .
the service as always is excellent and so is the food .
"if you are looking for below average cuisine , this is your place ."
the clinic itself is spacious and clean .
it was very quiet and the pool was very refreshing .
the worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant .
this place has been making great sushi and sashimi for years .
the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
this place is way cool !
we loved everything about this place .
the blt is the best on the menu .
each and every staff member truly cares about the patients well being .
i only end up there for convenience ... apparently the service staff thinks differently .
my veal with prosciutto and peas was memorable .
"rose was our waitress , bartender , and cashier ."
but i was n't going to be rude .
"place is really nice , clean and welcoming ."
"she did my daughters piercing , was super cool and friendly ."
loved the classes and the instructors were great .
they were referred by my doctor and i was very pleased .
my full set is uneven and lumpy .
it was her fault that she failed to ask how i wanted the wings .
this is not a place i would recommend .
will definitely stay here again if we ever go back to arizona !
"plus , i instantly have long , beautiful hair !"
"excellent food , we go here a few times a month ."
"when i got there , the service cashier was delightfully friendly ."
i hate to do this but the place is soooo bad .
your service completely sucks for lunch .
food was just as amazing as the service !
the plate also came with delicious potatoes and fresh fruit .
the place was very clean and friendly staff .
this place is worth the trip .
she is so sweet and so good with her .

customer service was terrible !
this is the absolute best pizza we 've ever eaten .
thank you alan for being awesome and honest .
and the taco shells had been par cooked to long in advance .
visited this lovely little piece of heaven today .
so being new to chandler i took this course as a kid friendly course .
"the prices are high , but the whole experience is worth it ."
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
make sure you make a reservation !
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
i have referred family and friends and will keep coming back !
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
mary checked my ring in about _num_ seconds and than cleaned it .
a manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit .

the service here is excellent even at the bar .
the service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing .
it was a fun environment to eat in .
the place is beautifully decorated .
"if you have a hangover and need grease , this is your place ."
we had carpet installed and sheet vinyl installed .

all of which is at a fair price .
"i really love salon tru , amanda is great ."
i recently purchased my wedding dress at this location and received exceptional customer service .

ordered spicy tuna roll and the thing came out ice cold .
plus the staff is friendly and attentive .
"we started with a artichoke to share , and it was a great treat ."
the beer selection was decent .
it 's a ride from the east valley but worth every mile .
came here with my family .
"he had a sampler with grape leaves , meat balls , rice , etc ."
always have good results and the staff has always treated us right .
"$ _num_ , if you want strawberry . )"
"needless to say with these ridiculous layers , i look awful ."
kaitlyn was absolutely delightful .
"besides the lack of product , the service here was terrible as well ."
wonderful breakfast we loved it !
the second time - what the heck happened ?
meatball sub was perfect as was my dad 's italian sandwich .
"prime rib was good , a little dry on one edge ."
"_num_ drink minimum , but do n't order a double ."
only breakfast was average .
we were both so impressed .
and most importantly i felt very safe as a single female traveling alone .
food tastes great and hot .
everyone loved their food .
"donuts are great , and pricing is good for whole family ."
all rooms were dark and dingy .
i yelled to her to stop .
used this florist for our wedding reception and what a great job they did .
the entire experience in dealing with her was horrible .
nothing came close to tasting anything like chinese food .
service is always good .
had a great time here !
i have recommended my friends and co workers to come to this place .
other restaurants give you steak in a bowl for about the same price .
"having worked in many years in medicine , i know the difference !"
this place is gross .
no call the day they were suppose to be done .
the boyfriend and i ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza .
my two year old was happily on his feet the whole time !
thank you kevin and staff !
it 's a winning combination of flavors .
it was apparent they did not give a damn about customer service .
the breakfast i had sucked tho .
"he replied that regardless , i parked walked inside and then walked out ."
the service was great but the food was no good .
"great service , waitress was on the ball with everything ."
hoping they change back to original chicken .
overall it was a nice place to relax and have a drink .
"by the way , the service was _num_ star all the way ."
they were beyond great in here .
and the staff was great .
the place it self is ok but she is just terrible person .
"i admit , the patio looked nice and the cushions were comfortable ."
it has failed to impress me on each occasion .
so he finally got to eat more after _num_ minutes of cooling .
"once we got home , the puppy started getting worse ."
he is obviously dedicated to his patients and it shows .
i moved here _num_ years ago and was afraid of finding a new dentist .
good service and deliver as we 'll keep ordering even my kids love it .
the water was just too hot even on vacation mode .
"they came back and replaced parts , but it was still not right ."
"if you do go , do n't get a salad ."
i really enjoyed eating breakfast here and would recommend it without hesitation .
my wife and i love the food here .
the doctor was also very helpful and understanding .
i will definitely recommend this place to anyone i know who gets engaged .
"if you 're visiting scottsdale , this place is a must chill out at !"
"happy hour prices are some of the best around , and the food ... ."
the spice levels are always right on with our tastes .
basically over americanized food that is way over priced .
it 's a great atmosphere !
he moved it in for me without a problem .
"decent food , wait staff is friendly ."
she sounded like she could care less also .
"our bruschetta appetizers were disappointing as well , we ordered all three ."
we got there right before the crowd hit !
the chicken fajita burrito fundido was delicious !
i am disappointed in this aaa service .
the doctors are compassionate and very knowledgable in what they do .
staff and the ride were terrific .
freshly made kimchi yummy .
"however , my first experience with gus ' was quite negative ."
we had a great workout and will be back .
the coffee was one of the worst cups of coffee i 've ever had .
but this place has really gone down hill .
"the second time , i had a hamburger and fries ."
i liked the heat of the salsa .
super clean and the drinks are always spot on .
the owners and staff are very friendly .
there 's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week .
i kind of think this place is highly overrated .
the food is delicious .
or maybe that 's just a waste of time .
the hype is not real .
each item is classic comfort with complex and elevated flavors .
if you just show up it 's $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
i always bring out of town family members and they love it !
the interior was very nice and our waiter was friendly .
i had the lamb shank and it was incredible !
"aaa , this is an insulting way to treat your members ."
ribs were terrible and tough as can be .
the food was good as always .
"stick with that , and you 're golden ."
this level of service is seldom found in this day and age .
their burritos are amazing along with their super nachos !
she did an amazing job on my color and my cut !
apparently they do n't split checks .
the bread was n't good at all .
so i paid full price for a very sad steak dinner .
but both were mediocre .
"but who knows , maybe that 's you ."
i just looked at my mom and said ... i can not eat this .
turns out ... walmart will only cash checks for people with superior credit .
worst part of all is the cornbread tasted `` flat '' .
all the pizzas sound good and i want to try each one .
the management is a joke and she is very rude .
all of his vendors are experienced and so easy to work with .
i highly recommend this office .
i love family businesses and this place is awesome .
i think that is beyond rude .
they are fast and always willing to change something if you ask .
"the service was terrible , and i got food poisoning ."
pedicures are still of the same quality i like to get .
do n't let the word scottsdale fool you this place is a complete ghetto .
got ta love the wings !
i just visited this spa yesterday and was not too happy .
the bathrooms were around bad .
i had a really nice time at the italian grotto .
"new menu , which is ugly by the way ."
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
"i mean really , really , really expensive ."
but even just getting pepperoni is amazing .
it 's amazing !
i recently moved from seattle and am so happy i found scarlett !
i love this place .
i arrived there at 10:30 and there was no line to get in .
smoking section is awesome .
the meal was yummy and authentic .
i highly recommend !
"they were on time , very polite and friendly ."
i 'm sure people who have money to burn say they 're great .
i despise going to this walgreens .
the grounds are absolutely immaculate !
the filet and prawns were outta this world !
their biscuits and gravy are the best !
the staff and service at this location is outstanding !
"well as soon as we walked in , it was a joke !"
service was attentive .
my wedding reception was flawless !
"the owner and his daughter are always very knowledgeable , friendly and helpful !"

"however , customer service was not so good ."
really enjoyed this little place .

the waitresses are friendly .
the egg drop soup literally just tasted like salt water .

it is wonderful italian food .
which i had no problem with .
the greek salad dressing is authentic and delish .
they didnt ship it out til three days later .
"we ordered the chicken monterey , build your tacos , along with green enchiladas ."
it is bible based and to the point !
this was a nightmare !
i had one of the best burgers of my life there .
this is great for mornings when i 'm in a rush .
it was all downhill from there .
i would n't hire them even if they paid me to do it .
the sauce on the meat was too heavy with lemon .
i love this place .
both sauces were awful .
buyer beware .
he was very friendly and informative .
the bacon was not a high quality product .
the girls are all super hot and definitely worth going and taking a look .

as usual the appointments went fantastic !
had a nice dinner here .
sides are good and feed _num_ .
"this is a large store , clean and well lit ."
"did not like orange or lemon chicken because of the thick , thick crust ."
this place is just an all-around great experience .
people living in this community have zero respect for one another .
we trust her and the cuts are always perfect .
overall i will not be back and was n't impressed at all .
it 's the principle of it that makes me so angry .
"but man , it 's just not anything special , and also overpriced ."
they brought me a burger with bun and cheese so i sent it back .
"the restaurant is traditional , service is kind and fast and prices are low ."
the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable !
service : nothing special and she overcharged us by double .
"i have never actually tried the cakes , but they look damn good ."
still do not like the service here .

these people are the worst .
no one was in the place when we came in .
"my girlfriend and i love it here , been coming for awhile ."
neither were satisfactory .
the prices are very reasonable as well .
this is the worst restaurant meal i have ever had .
we leave having eaten nothing .
that is the definition of excellent customer service .

this store is nasty .
i was so mad at her and myself .
i got a salad and it was fresh no brown spots or wilted greens .

the sound guy needs to realize this is an enclosed space and adjust accordingly .
instead of being reputable they told me to pick another package .

the best food here is in liquid form ( the beer ) .
a simple cheese crisp but made on a tortilla that stays crispy .

cute little place in the mall .
and that 's what surprises me .
this location is closest to my house and is open pretty late .
it looked so good and tasted even better .

"everybody is pretty friendly , especially in the smoking section ."
the waitress came running over with our bill .

it 's very sad and i have no idea how she stays in business .
a miserable experience that started before we were even in the parking lot .
_num_ minutes later we arrive at the restaurant and it is a zoo .
the meat and cheese platters and bruschettas are very good .
there are stacked empty shelves by the door .
got ta try it !
she was really amazing .
i was so pleased !
not sure if the guy was new or not .
id say best first impression !
this place is awesome !
my husband said the pancakes were hands down the best he 's ever had !
this place impressed us .
"the merchandise is of great quality , and they have a huge selection ."
great when you are at a doctor 's office .
the lack of consistent fees and policies has hurt my experience .
"great recommendations , personable and passionate about her work ."
we politely sent them back and asked for coffee instead .
i love to come and wander around at least once a month .
candy is an amazing waitress .
"as of late , they have been completely lacking in the customer service end ."
i came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was very disappointed .
i love yelp .
everybody says the economy sucks .
food is always fresh .
and my stomach was upset for about four hours after i ate it .
meanwhile they have all this cardinals signage up .
the older ladies that worked here were so friendly and helpful .
the food was not good and not worth the price .
i guess i 'll post another review when we get our food .
the service was also friendly and fast .
i was with my friend and her mom and the service was horrible .
"when that part was over with , dr. dan did what he does best ."
my tooth still has not been taken out after this unfortunate event .
"it 's loud , obnoxious crowd , and way too expensive !"
the staff are always very nice and helpful .
do n't even have words for what went down at improv tonight .
the reviews i read did not describe the food i ate .
we always get one of each `` heat '' .
i love the $ 5-6 soup !
"also , never got checked up on ."
the chicken is surprising better then other kfc .
the pizza and cannoli are also fantastic .
"after pointing out the issue , i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes ."
my beer and my other friend 's ice tea arrived quickly .
"definitely a good experience , i loved how helpful the girls were !"
the food is great as well .
do they really think that i am that dumb ?
they are always upfront and honest .
"was n't the best , but way better than the butter !"
this is the place to take it for just that !
nothing was `` bad '' it just was not good .
we drove to this bar on a recommendation from a friend .
the fried zucchini was great .
that was n't enough to stop me from getting this pizza again .
the bacon is perfect and their sandwiches are delicious on bread or a bagel .
"added bonus they have darts , shuffleboard , and board games all for free !"
we went with a group of eight and all had a great time .
"the food is delicious , the portions huge , the prices reasonable ."
the food was fresh and full of flavor without being heavy .
"they also charged us $ _num_ for the honey , really ?"

both doctors are wonderful .
"and for the prices we paid , it was not good enough ."
"love that you can get beer here too , they also deliver ."
but ... personality does not a good chinese restaurant make .
they make their pancakes with peanut oil .
i was also surprised with the portion of the quesadilla !
they serve sweet corn chicken soup -- a family favorite .
great company to choose ... if you do it correctly .
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too big .
"so ... ya , theres something for everyone ."
it 's delicious .
i honestly do n't understand how anyone can give this place any stars .
there was plenty of seating .
thank you giants for being so amazing !
everything we ordered was delicious .
"the lobster , i was told was o.k but nothing to rave about ."
are you kidding me ?
the calzone was delicious as was the chicken marsala !

even no it 's still wet everywhere !
the whole meal was disappointing .

the people were not very friendly and the food was so so .
"the chef , his food and his staff are a perfect combination ."
this place is fun to go hang out and drink a couple .
the manager did n't quite seem to feel too bad about what happened .
they always get the work done in a timely fashion .
customers are not your children .
our food was good and the drinks were great .
"after the show was over , our waitress came by with our bill ."
"the place was n't packed , but did have some tables ."
from the more recent reviews nothing has changed .
i find the food to be consistently good and the service is outstanding .
aaron offered a lot of assistance and helped guide me the right direction .
we started off dinner with the stuffed mushrooms ( they were excellent ! )
she listens to what i want and makes suggestions which always turns out great .
she seemed shy and had trouble talking to the table .
the service was great and would gladly go back .
we opted for the happy hour on the patio .
pad thai is also a must .

we tried blue adobe grille last night and it was fantastic .

overall that was the worst zipps experience i 've had .
everything was tasty !
"fast , friendly and had what i needed at a good price !"
we went late on a saturday night and had a good experience .
however i was there last weekend and something was seriously wrong .
i do n't even want to give them one star .
it takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon .
the caesar salad was watery and not seasoned properly .
very noisy if you yourself are n't going out drinking .
"however , this place really does suck ."
"i was told it was 1st come , 1st served ."
great service always when i stop for gas as well .
the service is exceptional and friendly and the food is amazing !
the cashier lacked any personality and it was like talking to a zombie .
just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat .
the waiter acted like he could not be bothered with the complaint .
"suffice to stay , this is not a great place to stay ."
the hotel was n't interested .
"walked over there for dinner - it was , of course , ridiculously crowded ."
the price point is excellent for the quality of food !
i love this place !
the haircut that i got is in no way what i clearly asked for .
this one is a gem in a town of overpriced chain look alike restaurants .
"food was really good , as was the service ."
i 'm pretty impressed by their value offering .
for them to do a simple order and they still got it wrong !
he is a fantastic bike technician and a super nice guy .
thumbs down .
"if you are in a pinch , they can usually squeeze you in ."
"there are two different bar areas , one inside and one outside ."
i had an excellent experience .
"i have been here quite a few times , nice place ."
i love seeing what they have brought to share .
both were excellent !
thank you so much for the wonderful floral arrangement for my friends !
it 's family owned and it shows that they are proud of their business .
the cashier is always friendly and the business seems to always have customers .
"they were professional , courteous , timely , and efficient ."
the house salad was boring and plain and well ... nothing special !
"overall food was amazing , price was worth every penny ."
staff are very courteous and kind .
the waiter was ridiculously rude .
the place is always spotless !
this has got to be the worst apartment complex i 've ever lived in .
the ambiance inside is really interesting as well .
worst kfc i have ever been to .
salad was the beet salad - not bad but heavy handed with the dressing .
"it could 've been great , but it was nowhere near good ."
this is sin for mexican .
the food is really greasy and lacks flavor .
they not only looked impressive in size but so delicious .
i 've already recommended scottsdale smile to my parents !
i love the staff and the doctors .
the pad thai was very average .
warning : horrible service do not come here !
crust was great though .
"on top of this , the wine selections were awful ."
so after showing our id 's we go in and grab some beers .
this place is just damn good !
it 's a bowling alley 1st and foremost .
i love it .

i go to leave and there is no co pay due at the time .
this place has excellent pizza and wings .
i love the community and the staff is always very friendly and helpful .
"ice cream here is light tasting , but the toppings make it delicious !"

it is busy all night .
i also enjoy their sushi and appetizers .

his bedside manner is not about manners at all .
the drinks were very good .
they said it would be _num_ hours until they could come out .
"price was wonderful , about half one of the others ."

the problem was the simple marinara sauce .

but we were n't happy with the experience .
the rib eye steak has some delicious wine gravy with mushrooms .
"already have sent my daughter there , will continue to recommend to everyone !"
"however , that did n't help with the flavor at all ."
"so , keep to yourself , get what you need and get out ."
service was friendly and efficient .
the service is nice enough and the place seem clean .
there were 5-6 serves standing there ignoring us .
this place is awesome !
i ordered chicken eggplant .
which is kinda a good thing .
i always leave the salon absolutely loving my hair cut and color !
the bartender makes prob some of the best hand crafted cocktails in the city .
this is not a resort or modern in the way you are thinking .
i do n't know how they have a lot of good reviews .
breakfast or brunch at lon 's is consistently delicious .
relaxed and good food that is not expensive .
the price is very reasonable .
all the barbers are top notch .
thank you !
it did n't seem that bad when we walked onto the patio .
"do you like great food , great service , and friendly environment ?"
the service was very good .
the weather is amazing and the patio is divine .
i really miss this festival !
there is lots of different types of draft beer and the service is excellent .
my hairstylist is amanda and she always gives me the best cut .
happy hour prices are hard to beat !
they always take good care of me and my family !
dr. wilson still refused to pay him !
mark taylor does n't care if your happy here .
"their dinner servings are worth the price , sesame chicken is amazing ."
when you arrive put away the expectations and just enjoy the bat cave .
the dish was terrible .
the spa is amazing and the sunday brunch is a must !
i highly recommend him .

everything was amazing except the pad thai .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .

this facility is extremely professional and clean .
the eggs were under cooked and the hollandaise was very bland .
unfortunately it 's where the birthday girl wants to eat .

it was really tough and extremely chewy .
i wish i could say the same for my burrito .
i know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me .
bowling is fun but they all are so dull and blah inside .
the only thing thai about malee 's are the owners .

never once did anyone apologize for being late .
"his staff is professional , informative and patient ."
prices are decent for what you get and the portions are generous .
what i ordered was very forgettable .
i have been going here for years and everything is delicious .
as a _num_ year old that is a big deal for me .
thank you !
this has always been one of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale .
i went there and i was quite happy .
they make great martinis too !
but from speaking with them on the phone they were very friendly and helpful !
friendly staff and everyone seemed like a local who came there often .
it is a old style burger joint that i will continue to visit .
i am not going here again .
the outside of the restaurant looks a little old but the food is great .
everyone enjoyed their meals .
next time i hit up the phx .
this place is pretty gross .
this place gets five stars for the quality of their food .
it came with many sides and even included a cinnamon tea at the end .
the club itself is ok and deserves _num_ stars .

angela is fantastic .
not the options i wanted .
i was very disappointed .
"the server was friendly , the food was good ."

this place is ridiculous .

the place was packed and there was only one grill available .
this place is worth a look !

it 's a relaxed sports bar with decent bar food .
"american cuisine seems to be flavored primarily with salt , fat and sugar ."
our second time here was just as great as the first .
my kids love it and the food is yummy .
body shop handled it .
the sound of children playing does n't bother me so much though .
"atmosphere is awesome , service is excellent ."
you ever wait in a car repair place with a baby ?
the service and chop salad was the only great thing here .
"he 's professional , awesome , knows his stuff ."
i was very pleased !
we also got a caesar salad that was really good as well .
the bartender was friendly and very quick .
i do n't eat bacon .
the veggie was better tasting than the pepperoni and i 'm not a vegetarian .
this dessert was the biggest let down .

"at night , this place is always run by a bunch of assholes ."
the food was not bad but the restaurant was just weird .
the feeling lasted for _num_ hours until i was finally able to fall asleep .
this was seriously was a waste of money and scary experience for me .
the grilled veggies were topped with olive oil and were tender and very tasty .
all you can eat shrimp really hits the spot !
this is a popular place and it gets crowded .
and to top it all off my boneless wings were barely coated with sauce .
the crust is too buttery and not crispy or chewy .
he referred me to a very expensive specialist to fix it .
i wish you good luck in your life and career girls !
sunday brunch here is awesome !
it was all great !
"i had the cod , rice , asparagus and such a wonderful combination ."
"the lamb was perfect , veal superb ."
somehow it was cold when it got to us .

( i did n't even know she had a yelp account ! )
i 've searched the valley for a bagel .
they have a good looking white pizza we 'll try next time !
well i love this place !
unfortunately we did n't enjoy the scallops or shrimp dish on the starters menu .
carne asada tacos are beef marinated in soy sauce powder and brown sugar !
i think they are very confused .
this place is great .
even the potato skins top our list for the best in the valley .
i have to stay another night tonight so we 'll see how it goes .
my coat was bagged and i paid the $ _num_ .

always order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get !
panang curry was the most perfect level of spice but only consisted of chicken .
i was extremely pleased with my experience .

she did clean the mess but with the biggest attitude ever .
the view is awesome !
"for about _num_ of us , it came out to be $ _num_ ."
all the bartenders are amazing .

i checked this place out from former reviews which all seemed very good .
their dressings are fantastic !
pretty much worse experience i 've had with mcdonald 's .
"fry 's , you just lost a long term customer !"
he is absolutely amazing and very sincere .
and it is a local az company .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
had a great time at this bar !
getting a refill was not easy .
the music was a little too loud and the interior was predictable .
no one would even acknowledge that we were there !
cute little nail salon for a girls day out .
now i want that for dinner !
ra does n't serve sushi .
have always enjoyed our visits here .
"food was over priced , terrible and it took over an hour ."
it 's not worth saving a few hundred dollars .
the programs turned out beautifully and they were the perfect addition to the wedding .
uncle sal 's did a fantastic job and our waitress was great .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life !
my beans were of the canned variety that they clearly just heat up .
let me just start by saying i loved sushi _num_ until tonight .
thank you james !
reasonable rates and i am confident in the care that the animals are given .
i asked for some help to remove the storage fees but they would n't .
service is pretty good .
my vision has never been anywhere near this good !
it always works .
"the place was not busy , but there was no sense of urgency whatsoever ."
return are limited days and bad thing of all low experiences .
atmosphere is relaxed .
"great place to dine , if you 're ever in the downtown scottsdale area ."
she was n't managing anything .
she 's fantastic and such a doll .
"went for breakfast this morning , was n't very busy and service was horrible ."
food and service were very good .
"in fact , the edge looked better than showroom ."
not sure why we even decided why to try something new .
the lunch portions are huge and the food is delicious .
jeff from j & h plumbing is great !
"the ice cream is excellent , yummy and lots of choices and affordable ."
i was disappointed nobody came to her aid .
they are the best in town .
needless to say my nails were breaking within a week .
such a shame that reputable company like this does that .
we prefer to patronize local businesses but you 've lost our business .
my wife loves their gyros .
my sales guy was riley and he was amazing .
then i pick up my car and he charges me $ _num_ .
"wow , was this one a disappointment !"
first of all the old lady at the counter was extremely rude !
the bathroom is clean and nice and so is the rest of the store !
i found both new and consignment furniture .
"it was fun , and the food was pretty awesome ."
i always get chicken and it 's really tasty .
i could not believe that so many others had the same experience .
it was sorely disappointing .
my husband 's review is excellent show .
everyone was extremely nice and professional .
"thanks pop the soda shop , for ruining everything ."
i had the worst experience here this morning .
beans and tortillas are top notch .
family owned & operated .
this is my all time favorite and birthday every year restaurant .
"was n't greeted , just looked at ."
and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find .
two months later i received a missed appt bill of _num_ .
the grocery store is pretty inexpensive and they have a good selection of food .
the staff was very friendly but the food was incredibly bland .
"but never the less , the burger was still delicious as ever !"
went for happy hour with my love .
after a few weeks of sessions i experienced an increase of focus and relaxation .
qt and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper .
had very nice experience with take out .
tina was absolutely wonderful !
"just fyi , it 's mostly an older crowd ."
"the salon is fine but colleen , the stylist is amazing ."
best kept secret in town .
the food is always fantastic and they do a mean gin and tonic .
this year was such a disappointment .
_num_ thumbs down for this location .
"if you 're cowboy ciao , the answer to all of these is no ."
he is a very compassionate doctor and a pleasure to work with .
the hot tea was like plain hot water .
"ordered the brisket , wife pulled pork ."
"no , cake can not replace sex , but it definitely tastes good ."
i called the number twice and it just rang and rang .
"at this point , we felt like we 'd been there forever ."
the server repeated my order .
"the place was clean , and the receptionists were really nice ."
tried a few other rolls as well with my table and some specialty cocktails .
i signed up for their email and got a coupon .
for beer lovers papago is probably the best place in the greater phoenix area .
i found this place on google and decided to give it a try .
the service was really fast and extraordinarily friendly .
"the day before our dinner , we had one more decide to join us ."
"soup , salad , drinks , all served at the same time ."
thank you for keeping such fine quality and amazing wait staff !
the food was incredible .
cheap drinks and great food always make me happy !
this was surprisingly good for a random trip into a strip mall .
"this place offers solid , delicious take out ."
everything was wonderful .
not sure why they do n't have at least a _num_ star rating .
an added benefit is having the lab `` in house '' .
the mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh .
the lettuce was limp .
"really good korean bbq , and you grill it yourself at your table ."
maybe it was the horribly loud music ; maybe the surreal atmosphere .
the food that was suppose to be hot was luke warm .
the room was nice and clean .
i am happy with the results and i plan on going back soon .
here we are today -- _num_ days later and still a broken pool system .
sally is great .
the bill was way too high for such mediocre food .
my favorite is the biscuits and gravy .
"this is my favorite local pizza , hands down ."
the course is pristine perfect including the greens and fairways .
i paid and left and will not be back .
"good service , nice selection and everything was fresh ."
the cruise was good .
"i ordered over the phone for delivery and it was literally , the worst ."
"at which point he walked away , never to be heard from again ."

there 's no other way to say it .
the last french dip i got was pathetic with small portion of beef .
"on the positive side , the lettuce was green and was as expected ."
the only reason they get a _num_ is because the food was packaged nicely .
the ring is beyond beautiful - delicate and perfect in every way .
the ribs were extremely tough and did not fall off the bone .
the customer service continues to be lacking with poor follow through .
some ppl may call her rude but i think she is very real .

"they came with a generous amount of bacon , too ."
this is a great company .
i love the atmosphere & especially their delicious ice cream .
and the courses themselves were pretty nice .
"i got what i wanted , hot , and quick ."
this is definitely a place to try at least once !
the staff was n't overly polite .
we went on a friday night and it was packed with people !
"besides being ridiculously rude , they have very inflated prices ."
i asked the server if the potatoes were real .
my issue is with the professionalism of the staff .
the crust is tasteless & the quality just is n't there .

views are incredible .
a half order is plenty and will amaze you .

it 's like licking a salt lick ... .
i called the dealership and was told that this is standard .
someone obviously did not use enough grounds .
its easy to see that all of the employees take pride in the business .
the double baked potato was dry and bland .
waiting room is very small .
so whatever they suggest i recommend ordering one spice level down .
the drinks were good and sushi as good if not better .

so my brand new pair sold in zero days and i got $ _num_ .
joe and beth are honestly just the best !
i 'm a city girl so it 's all new to me .

it 's not that hard to please the customer .
we love this place !

they are not interested in quality of service .
i get the gyro platter which provides you with a lot of meat .
it is always clean and the staff is super friendly .
the dish came very fast ( _num_ minutes ) and the service was great .
"regardless , i just do n't feel i can trust marshall 's anymore ."
the store is well organized and the produce always seems fresh .
there was only meat and bread .
my little guy loves it too !
that was _num_ weeks ago .
the guy just gave me a short `` no . ''
i will definitly bring my mom here when she visits in the spring .
she takes the time to style it how i want it done .
i personally like the border bowl but everything is good .
the fish and steak were both perfectly cooked .
the staff was very friendly and helpful .
"after we got our appetizer and drinks , our server abandoned us ."
without a doubt this is the best pizza scottsdale can offer !
first off i went there to grab lunch and i ordered my food .
it 's the only reason this place is getting their _num_ star .

"it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed ."
"the veal , chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing ."
the place was only 1/3 full .

their egg rolls are pretty good along with their sweet and sour sauce too .
and is slow service ever an acceptable policy !
i tried the spaghetti bolognese and it was amazingly good .
i love the atmosphere of the restaurant .
so i proceed to go every 5-7 days for shots .
"great store , very clean and laid out well ."
i have no idea why people rave about this place .

from start to finish i was really happy with every step .

they have some weird system where everyone helps out with all tables .
everything else was great .

what this restaurant does is so easy !
the portions were humongous and it was very delicious .
i sincerely appreciate great customer service and that is exactly what we received tonight .
loved this place !
"the food is really good , but sometimes can take a little while ."
they carry very special furniture lines and have something for everyone .
it certainly is not the place featured on the show !
no matter what you order the salsa and hot sauce are n't good .
their red salsa was spicy and addicting .

"apparently they were understaffed , as if that was an acceptable excuse ."
i have always used this discount tire .

the menu is really good and authentic .
"when i stepped in to grab the order , the restaurant stunk ."
she was clueless on how to shape them .
"low and behold , our food arrives and neither steak is correct ."
her attitude stuck out the whole meal .
"they are knowledgable , friendly , and very helpful ."
i 'm so happy we came by .
she says 3-4 weeks out to schedule .
we ordered pizza for the table and everyone really enjoyed it !

my mother and i had a very pleasant experience here today .
everything was very good .

i really have tried to give this restaurant a shot .

he is absolutely an amazing surgeon .
"plus he has amazing prices , how could you not go ?"

not the quality i expected .
"said , `` i am an officer , you are a fucking private . ''"
so i left my name and number for them to call me back .

they loved the rock climb .
there was no time to enjoy anything .
the soup is absolutely to die for .
really disappointed in the experience i had tonight .
we all came away with good deals .
he listens well and he is nice to talk to .
the woman who runs the shop is rude .
they constantly have their friends here to chat and smoke cigarettes with .
the breakfast club is as good as you 'll find .
"i love the bento boxes , everything is always fresh ."
it is better than even oregano 's !
we were super disappointed in the service we received from them .

he was rude and dismissive .
rick and his team are truly the best !
"so as you can see , they 're pretty pretentious and blatantly rude ."
price is fair for what you get .
found this store online and made a trip while going to scottsdale .

do go and see what they have - you will be so impressed !
this used to be one of my favorite places on mill .
i love this hospital and their staff !
"lastly , this it the thing that bugs me the most ."

"next time we are in scottsdale , we will be back !"
absolutely loved the chopped salad and the grilled shrimp over corn salsa .

about _num_ minutes later we were seated .
"with think fries and attentive service , this place is fun and delicious !"
"however , it just keeps getting worse ."
"fire is cool , lol ."
"sweet , spicy , you name it ."

service was reasonably good .
the people do n't care !
we paid $ _num_ a glass for a _num_ alexander valley cab .
"swing in and give them a try , you 'll be glad you did !"

"between three people , we shared the top hat and dusty road sundaes ."
the service was very slow and the restaurant floor was very grimy .

he walked _num_ miles the other day .
it was a huge portion and fresh fish .
the mac and cheese was literally a few noodles and some watery cheese sauce .
this place was terrible !

it has such an elegant vibe .
they tried other upscale items too .

our group of _num_ went here after having good experiences in the past .
how do you get rid of _num_ % fat and _num_ % calories ?
boyfriend 's oatmeal was cold .

my group really enjoyed the outdoor dining on their amazing patio .
my calamari was so so .
i 've always loved this place and the chips and salsa are awesome !

"however , i think the food is pretty bland ."
the christmas decor is amazing !
they have the best orange chicken and kung pao .
"the place was clean and looked very elegant , a real surprise ."
reserved a room here for the navy ball .
it is not worth whatever savings you think you may get .

i do n't know many people who could now a days .
the deli slaw was soaked in vinegar .
only thing that i ate was the milk .
"sauce is good , and the mozzarella is fabulous ."
the food is not original or even tasty .
the bread was n't really that great .
pharmacist is so funny !
ate there for the first time sunday and we loved it .
desserts are straight-forward and well executed .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
you can tell she feels like a million bucks !
probably one of the best pizzas i have ever had .
my server did n't really seem to care about my experience either .
my wife had the chicken fried steak and potatoes ... same thing .
kendra nails it each and every time .
the food is great !
i 'm almost certain the woman serving us was completely wasted too .
i tried a bite .
the house chianti was very good .
great variety and delicious dessert which i ordered coconut ice cream .
there was no wait here on a wednesday night around 7:30 !
no thanks - i think i 'm officially done .
the security staff is pretty awesome as well as the bartenders .

i finally found my dive bar .
$ _num_ pie with fees and tax was $ _num_ .
we had a party of six and ordered _num_ different sushi rolls .
they are dishonest !
"the flowers were fresh , and they were delivered on time ."
$ _num_ gets you a car wash and vacuum - nothing extra .
it is beautiful !
our water glasses were filled though because the busser was amazing .
this was a nice place !
had to wait _num_ minutes for a burger and fries .
i am not a huge fan but i have had worse .
which made me sad to hear .
surprise ... they changed the oil and they said everything was good .
"i used to love the improv , i hated when it closed ."
her color and cut are always spot on .
changed my battery out and did a great job .
unfortunately i ended up leaving very unsatisfied in the job done .
i 'd recommend checking this place out if you 're in the area .
looks the waiters just dont want to work !
at least the fries were fresh and did n't taste of yesterday 's oil .
they are so fabulous here !
that 's the only reason the rating is so low .
at no time did they tell me financing would be a problem .
"they were very genuine , nice , and helpful ."
the waiters all treat you well .
i do n't even want to waste time typing about the curry .
"the hollandaise sauce is disgusting , and the ham needs to be sliced much ."
"in conclusion , this business deserves to fail ."
two of the nine diners went hungry despite a $ _num_ bill .
cons : pizza did not taste good .

this place is the best .
it was amazing .
"the prices are good , the food is warm and the coffee is hot ."
this place is great .
the gyro meat is incredible !
she is incredible .
it does n't and your marketing sucks .
bad customer service and trucks that are in poor working condition .
"anyway , one thing to ring home about was the lettuce wraps app ."
are you kidding me ?
recommend this place if you 're visiting and you need your italian food fixing !
"the coffee , thankfully , was hot enough to melt it down the throat ."
the service was also great .
the teachers are awesome and help me when ever i ask .
ultimately drinking it is not good for your body .

the new doctor in this office is absolutely amazing .

it was terrible .
if i could give this pizza hut no stars i would .
the staff here is fabulous .
my boss brought me here and bought me bread as a treat .
the bills were all wrong .
i was extremely disappointed .
it 's kind of off putting .
"still , it took _num_ minutes to get a table ."
( have n't been back since july ) .
we are from out of town and have had a great stay here !
it was like taking $ _num_ and burning it in front of me .
schnitzel was as tough as leather .
customer service is always perfect !
have found some great gems for some awesome prices .
the best meal i 've had in a long time .
sorry it 's a bit late .
i 'm recommending her to all my friends !
"waiter did n't tell us specials , barely paid attention to us ."
the coffee milkshake is a classic .
needless to say it has been a very stressful occasion .
like this is not a priority at all .
buffet had too many similar choices .
the food was good .
the receptionist is also super nice and professional .
"great food , good prices , and the customer service is too notch ."
"personally , i 'm not a fan ."
best clam chowder i 've had !
"maybe , but this ran me nearly _num_ $ ."
the food was okay ... an outback steakhouse would have tasted better .
our waiter was sweet and gracious .
this place is great !
we shared the apple pancake and it was oh so good !
crappy music they torture me with .
we immediately had our room changed to a room overlooking the parking lot .
you 'll only end up disappointed if you do n't .
that 's how good the food is !
the mixed drinks are horrible !
my favorite is the super sub !
i found several perfectly regal items and got out for less than $ _num_ !
"went to santisi brothers for the super bowl , it was great !"
the best part : it 's a drive thru !
this store is amazing .
if you so happen to enjoy their beer so much .
"however , it was a total buzz kill for our saturday night ."
a few hours after leaving here i was rushed to the er .
i really enjoy el sol .
the food came out lukewarm at best .
"they offered a free dental exam , which i accepted ."

the chicken pasta is the best here .
my salad was a little better .
"i also found the professionalism , advice and fitting to be of superior quality ."
they rip you off .
"it is romantic and beautiful , perfect for a fancy 2nd date ."
there are so many better places in old town than this hell hole .
"she is accomodating , detailed , specific and she works her tail off ."
it looked flat and it did not taste good .
the service was very spotty .
there was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted .
the sandwiches had a lack of flavor .
everyone knows everyone .
there are two long disgusting hairs in my burger .
thank you !
the winter beer festival was just ok .
there really was n't anything all that special there on my trip .
we love the staff and they are all so good with my dogs .
i went in for a routine visit and then get a bill .
"other than the manager , most else was a zero ."
it tasted horrible !
went for happy hour and was impressed with the selection of drinks and appetizers .
one word sums this place up ... avoid !
i was really impressed with this restaurant .
attitude and turned it in to a good days work .
"i was glad there was no wait , which actually surprised me ."
genuinely cares about his patients .
"unfortunately , management needs an attitude adjustment ."
needless to say i was n't going to pay the higher price and walked .
place is awesome .
thank you !
i just went here with my daughter .
the crust is perfect .
the food was very good .
"everyone i have encountered has been very nice , welcoming and helpful ."
"i 've had a few , but none were good ."
a zero is appropriate here but is n't a choice .
it stinks .
i go in for a cleaning and then get a bill .
"carne asada burrito was okay , but nothing outstanding ."
"if you need a great hat , definitely check this place out ."
everything was a salt bomb .
i even took my parents here and they agreed with my review .
food was delicious .
"i heard rumors , but i drove by tonight just to see for myself ."
they have quality food and i love everyone that works here !
"the coffee is reasonably priced , but the food is too expensive ."
i loved every minute .
check it out if you 're in town .
but they are close and deliver !
"the cole slaw was n't bad , but was still too sweet ."
she is as wonderful as always and does a perfect job every time .
i 'm comparing it to other seafood restaurants period .
sometimes it 's perfect ... not always .
first time going today and i got the new york pastrami .
"once , twice , three strikes , you 're out ."
this was the winner .
that was definitely a good choice .
beans and rice were not good at all .
"consistent , quality food - we enjoy going there about once a month !"
the meal is supposed to come with a small salad and garlic bread .
this management now is horrible .
kale salad exceptionally tasty and i 've never liked kale before !
very professional service and i was pleased with the alteration .
"waited _num_ minutes for the check , ."
or probably not since the air was n't blowing .
the bar is outside ( which i loved ) and the food is indoors .
this is the best corn bread on the planet .
everything at the buffet was just awful .
i really enjoyed this place !
the good news that my vision had improved made the visit even better .

this is my absolute favorite place to go for a nice dinner .
they have always been professional and fair .
the steaks and meats are great .
they do n't cook the fried rice in front of you .
nice place to play darts if you 're into that .
he 's truly the best !
"smiley nails is a great experience ; relaxing , professional and personal ."
"even when moving out , no one had a clue ."
if you sit in the bar they have the best bartender in town .
the bar food is awesome and is priced really good .
burger had little to no frys .
calling my review a rant is not good customer service .
this place is super awesome !

i 'm not moving in !
it was like some sort of sleep torture .
"i wanted the advertised deal as advertised , nothing more , nothing less ."

this place is a little gem !
it is a nice change of pace from the chain restaurants in the area .

they really made us feel like they valued our business .
the people are super nice .

it 's interesting .
just to find inside that there is no seating anywhere .
they are priceless !
the bar 's selection of liquor is very impressive and pretty affordable .
management appears brain dead .
the amount of money they were asking was unreasonable .
maybe it cost you $ _num_ .
"the chips and salsa were okay , not great ."
"we found everyone to be very friendly , fun to talk to and professional !"
i love coming here for lunch .
it does n't mean i like the place all that much .
"and i had my sugar bowl favorite , the top hat sundae !"
i walked out of that place and convinced others to go with me .
my experience with this hall was terrible !
the food is only average as is the wine .
went in on a sunday with a sunday only coupon .
please know that this is a dog friendly restaurant .
i got some of wings and their steak sandwich ( thursday special ) .
i look and feel like a different person ( in a good way ) .
"folks , be warned that this place is terrible !"
needless to say i 'm never going back .
there are enough cockroaches for a horror film .
she is the best !
the lunch offered buffet style meal along with regular menu orders .
every time i 've been here the food has been great .
"the price was good , and even better , the pizza was quite good ."
the worst part was the service .
"i 've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years , i get it ."

i wish i would have read the yelp reviews before taking my truck there .
pad tai was particularly tasty !
the salon has a great vibe and friendly atmosphere .
thank you for the follow up call .

my family and i ate here a few months back .

highly recommend this darling local pizzeria !
it 's not bad at all .
the monthly rent is about _num_ % above market rate .
i wish them luck .
we ordered a side of cucumber yogurt which was perfect with the main course .
the problem was the food .
these guys are incredible .
plus they have good wifi .
the course and clubhouse has improved immensely over the years !
"i have only been here once , but will definitely be back !"
a lot of the stuff was extremely used and very overpriced .
i liked the selection of wines .
the sushi and teppanyaki are respectable .
at this point i was so confused !
this store does not have a large selection of items .
service was great and the view was pleasant .
i 'm in love with red !
they nailed it !
it 's a very relaxing spot .
"eventually our table was moved , but it took a while ."

finally he just ordered straight bourbon .
overpriced menu and they wonder why it is half empty on a friday night !
"we got the meat pizza , which was great ."
we had n't even sat down when the chips and salsa arrived .
i tried to go beyond that and ordered _num_ different dishes .
"the service was great , ambiance perfect , and of course the food !"
chips were fresh and salsas were tasty .
the crowd is always fun and chill .
i refer everyone and anyone to this place .
"it was delicious and beautiful , exactly what we had wanted ."
she did n't even clear our plates at the end of our meal .
mexican latte is so tasty !
the worst dry cleaners i have ever been to !
"the marina sauce was so good , just what i wanted ."
very quaint little place with locals who enjoy the services they provide .
they are so friendly and helpful !
i love their frozen edamame and their carrot cake is delicious .
i just love this place .
there is very little fish on the rolls compared to other sushi places .
every park i 've been to in the valley has provided a better experience .
the chop salad is amazing .
ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night .
it has no flavor and it is rubbery .
"first , i just stopped in on a whim ."
no i mean this is every single time i come here .
troy was exceptional !
scarlett is wonderful and gives a great hair cut every time .
they have really good on the go style breakfast sandwiches .
"this is the friendly , local bike shop you are looking for ."
i 've given it several tries and have been disappointed every time .
his apology was pathetic .
the girl bar is beautiful and we are enjoying paint nite !
the beer i had was icy cold .
the steak has a great smoky taste to it.
not as good as we were expecting .
"still a shrimp novice , i had no clue ."
she was positive and gave me hope when i needed it most .
the bartenders are pretty cool .
the bagels were very salty tasting and hard .
"i especially love their breakfast burritos , they are amazing !"
but the sales associate repeatedly told us the problem was our budget .
the only thing marquee has going for it is size .
just had lunch here and it was pretty good .
i do n't know how you make a medium well burger that fast .
i have had breakfast and also have had dinner and it was just awful .
i recommend the jalapeo chips .
bob is absolutely fantastic .
rice and beans makes a bland burrito .
i highly recommend this place !
i had about _num_ minutes left and ordered as much as i can .
it is what it is .

just dump stuff in the eggs and you 're done .
the salads are equally as good .
my double baked potato was fine and desserts were at best average .
he is amazing !
the outdoor patio was great and made the dinning experience that much better .
"clean , professional , and truly cares about our dogs ."
"the price is affordable for a place , groups are welcome ."
the raspberry champagne is great as well .
food was fantastic .
this is the first place i go when shopping for produce !
he doesnt seem to care what breaks in the place .
"however , from the start our server was extremely rude ."
the food is delicious .
this place is great .
nothing really seemed to go together .
that is why they get one star .
wish i could do _num_ stars .
it was nothing special .
"chicken or lamb does n't matter , they are both very good ."
"the food is pretty fast , and always tasty ."
everyone who works there is so nice and i always get great service .
i always get sushi and love it !
the staff is always very friendly .

the service is fast and friendly .
thank you guys !
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
the atmosphere was great !
they were horrible .
husband is also a fan .
i walked in today ready to spend money and the service was unbelievably unhelpful .
wings are outstanding as well .
"the employees always remember me and my dog , which is very nice ."
it was a a little warm in the location !
thank you charlie & midas !
i have never been rushed out of a restaurant so quickly .
i love everything about it !
friendly service and when you enter they open door for you .
she thought it was gross too .
this place has great pizza !
we loved him and also a few other comedians .
they provide great customer service .
but when it comes to customer service it really lacks .
place was also very clean .
she received amazing care .
highly recommend this place .
after waiting in line _num_ minutes i ordered the italian combo to go .
"all dishes are huge , including the kids meals ."
went for the midnight and it was so cool !
and it came with two whole pieces of chicken breast .
apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly .
the food had good flavor and variety .
service was tolerable .
my wife said the tamales were the best she has ever had .
my favorite is getting the lunch special pizza and having prosciutto added to it .
we also had good service that kept our iced teas filled .
"the bad : god , i fucking hate this joint ."
"reasonable price , had a great red curry !"
we cancelled our tv service _num_ months ago .
this is my favorite restaurant !
this place is a nightmare .
and the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending .
the staff was so sweet and helpful .
mani was good too .
"oh , and pastor brian does a great job too ."
the pizza taste great too !
"for the price of the food , i expected it to be hot ."
they were a big hit !
the owner greeted us immediately & was super friendly .
we were in the second row and the audio was terrible .
i love the disney store !
they always have a couple specials that are mouth watering .
thank you !
talk about hidden gem .
"safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy ."
the ribs were over cooked and dry .
it 's a quick go to meal .
i got a great price with a great warranty .
"although the the filet was good , i will never eat there again ."
"she appeared very angry at my request , and called her manager again ."
then it grew to _num_ customers and one waitress .
we tried the cod both fried and baked .
the first problem happened with my fianc 's business shirts .
still he was unsatisfied .
"there was a mistake on our bill , so we flagged down a waitress ."
the jalapeo mashed potatoes are delicious .
no amount of cleaning you do will be good enough to not be charged .
i also like their lunch combos .
even hot it was not good .
took it out for my first ride this morning and it was great !
the food here was way too salty and bland .
staff was really nice .
"most importantly , i had a really good time ."
our server made great suggestions .
i 'm rolling my eyes at you .
we take all our commercial as well as my personal vehicles here .
but do not eat entree 's .
then i went in my room and i thought someone was still staying there .
standing directly in front of him without a drink is not enough ?
"have been going here for years , love it ."
"quick , prompt service , they fixed everything and even went above and beyond ."
_num_ weeks go by and no follow up call or anything .
customer service is not a focus of this office .
i love the enchiladas with both green and red sauce .
"the staff was smiling , happy and the vibe was great ."
"maybe it was an off night , i just would n't recommend it ."
man o boy is it good !
speaker system worked nice so everyone heard the whole ceremony .
we were double billed and the service was horrible .
they always have the best customer service and friendly staff !
"overall , it 's a great burger and good vibe ."
i love their food and it is always consistent .
always fresh and good prices but it 's just fantastic .
the wine list was nice and different .
"this establishment is family owned , into its third generation , i believe ."
ill find somewhere else to spend my money i guess .
this place is horrible !
i had prime rib and it was perfect .
these guys moved my baby grand piano last week .
"however , today i had the most utterly disgusting experience of my entire life ."
there was no empathy at all .
seems a little long to me for such a small place .
this restaurant is at the base of the mountain so the view is amazing !
fyi not friendly on the dog patio .
this place is more like a sports bar than anything .
had a great breakfast .
there is just junk exposed all over and the menu is very small .
her ma vanessa is fantastic also .
the crispy fish with mango was so good !
thank you for making his birthday one to remember !
went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed .
_num_ mins goes by and we try to find our waitress .
place is too small .
i love this place ... .
the roasted vegetables were decent but the garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special .
the number six special is my regular .
i had a really fun time exploring scottsdale and phoenix !
how hard is it to make chicken wings ?
"even on that standard , i give it a _num_ out of _num_ ."
brenda and julie in the office are very professional and helpful .
truly wonderful company who comes through on their promises .
the service by the young lady was exceptional .
he is not returning any of my calls .
the sommelier helped us to select a great italian wine ( $ _num_ ) .
"moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless ."
i would hardly say _num_ strawberries are worth _num_ .
"btw , they are very reasonable too !"
"if you 're a vegetarian , you 'd do better to eat at lalibela ."
i liked the sunday morning menu .
they make seasonal dishes and have a interesting menu .
"an hour later , no pizza , so i called ."
the garlic edamame was really good .
the staff is helpful .
all of the food that i had was excellent .
mickey is the best !
the burros were alright but i 've had much better .
oh ... the food is still incredible .
everyone was very nice .
"generally speaking , the hotel is `` ok '' ."
the pizza is excellent .
_num_ minutes later i get an angry knock at the door .
they are playing mexican music on 4th of july ... not even speaking english .
it was wonderful .
"please , go here , i promise you will not regret the choice !"
this place has a really neat menu .
table near us complained numerous times over less than desirable service .
"anyway , then she saw my credit card which was a southwest credit card ."
another great thing about this place is they sell it by the slice .
this sushi place is amazing .
"our waiter was awesome , very good attention ."
this place is awesome !
i found a ton of awesome glass sets when i was there .
service has always been consistently very good !
very enjoyable and relaxing time we had .
ton of fries with my sandwich and the sandwich was pretty good !
the employees there just pass you on to another employee .
"it was gross , tasted old and bad fishy ."
prime rib burger was super delicious !
she reluctantly gave it back .
was drinking beers was rude and extremely unprofessional .
it was good .
every time i come here i 'm annoyed by the girl that helps me .
staff is very friendly and prices are defiantly the lowest .
"the whole team is so professional , immaculate and amazing ."
they encourage you to leave it in front outside where everyone comes and goes .
and do not go here if you want friendly service .
everything was very very plain .
there 's just something about it that keeps me wanting more .
the employees are always rude and could care less about your order .
i absolutely love salon tru !
there are way better places around for thai or asian food .
i literally spent almost nine hours with this one transaction .
it 's not my scene .
"unfortunately , the meal was disappointing ."
we had a wonderful experience here and will definitely be back .
did n't really say sorry or offer discounts or anything .
so glad art one gallery exists !
the menu has a great selection to choose from .
ick ick ick .
plus they have really good happy hour .
imagine how pissed i was .
the hummus was good but it was the falafel that was really good .
prices are reasonable and they have a nice selection of food to choose from .
i am a huge fan of the reverse happy hour also .
that 's definitely one of the biggest highlights .
randy is easy to work with and we refer everyone to him .
shrimp was okay and the fries were good too .
their selection of beer and wine is very good .
it was tough and just very unappealing .
happy hour provides some god deals on beer and wine so that helps .
i would not recommend eating here unless they change management .
i do n't see the big deal .
"our hotel , and our friends suggested this as the spot for breakfast ."
i 'm so thankful i found my new hair person .
pretty good and they deliver !
"it was expensive , portions were small for the price ."
the whole set up was ridiculous .
the rice is the best anywhere around .
she does the best work and is so pleasant and nice .
"technically , i was ripped off too ."
very educational and the tours are small in size .
the price was terrific and would play this course again .
the cheese bagels are the best around .
"honestly , this was way below average ."
i love love love my sister 's closet !
he gave me the price & procedure for servicing the machine .
they were so rude and i was so appalled at this kind of service .
so we probably had paid more than $ _num_ dollars in vet bills here .
the event included a _num_ course meal which was not good .
she absolutely did not go out of her way to help the customer .
this place is absolutely horrible .
did not try the food and probably will not .
it was a spectacular event !
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
the short gentleman approved and was so rude and condescending to us .
our waiter would disappear & left us for _num_ mins after giving our bill .
happy hour on friday and saturday is from 10pm to midnight .
"went with my wife and son , ordered three different dishes and shared ."
the subs are so delicious .
everything about this place is disappointing !
the renovation is awesome !
"i completed the course feeling upset , hurt and angry ."
my fries were now cold .
staff looks miserable and is not friendly .
"unfortunately , that time has come and gone ."
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
this place is our safe place .
there are some tvs to watch the game as well .
i love the layout .
no one seems to care about what there doing .
"and this week i am very , very upset ."
go in ... the food is really good at a reasonable price .
"then we waited ... _num_ minutes , _num_ minutes ."
there are many other italian restaurants that are better than this one .
he is very gentle and kind .
i will say ruth 's chris is consistent when providing quality food and service .
and these idiots put my truck through the was with the back window down .
also had an orange blossom smoothie which was delicious !
she 's just one of my favorite people in the world !
they are quite simply the most professional and best real estate school in arizona .
"if that describes you , this place is a pretty good choice ."
this is one of the best korean places i 've been to in az .
"kicked back , friendly crowd , good wine , good fare , reasonable prices ."
just crappy mexican food the best part was the mexican flag in my food .
the waitress was kind enough to take our chilaquiles dishes off our bill .
i recommend them to everyone and i recommend them to you !
our server was very attentive and friendly .
for the main course i selected the exotic mushroom pan fry .
the hot bar selection is thin but also excellent quality .
it is a parent 's dream !
it 's very bad service .
the food is great .
no hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita .
i only go there for the breakfast burritos and they are amazing .
this time around i was quite disappointed .
everybody is always friendly and i 've never had a problem with the service .
"overall , it 's a nice place and good food ."
i liked the ceviche and the drinks .
took another _num_ minutes to get just one bloody mary .
"a bowl of soup , veggie platter , margherita and guacamole cost $ _num_ ."
the patio is excellent for beer drinking and hanging with friends .
i love the place .
is wonderful .
everything was good .
i do n't really get the crowd here .
that 's nearly unacceptable in this day and age . )
"they have amazing coffee , a must for breakfast !"
their gluten free margarita pizza with fresh basil is to die for .
there are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better .
but the real gem here is the wine cellar .
it was perfect .
yum i love the food !
i guess only the employees can dress in skimpy attire .
hot sauce was neither hot nor saucy .
their phone etiquette is not pleasant .
the decor is very good.
this place has become a family tradition with my wife and i .
i then asked to speak to the general manager and he was not available .
the service was also impeccable .
it has so much charm .
we just did n't even bother eating there .
had a very relaxing weekend and will come back for sure !
i just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters .
the only soda they have is coke .
definitely recommend this dish !
i walked in and there was no greeter .
lukewarm pizza under heating lamps that is dried out and extremely overpriced !
the salad and sandwiches we ordered were just average .
"the crispy roll was n't crispy , more ... the opposite of crispy ."
the guy behind the counter was full of recommendations and super nice .
service is so bad everytime i go i kick myself for going .
during our entire dining experience they made no mention of my birthday to us .
the sales representative was excited to help me and very knowledgeable .
this is definitely one of the better fast food mexican restaurants .
"the bar manager , jack , was extremely friendly and personable ."
"the breakfast was good , but the fudge was great ."
i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dental practice .
they offer truly authentic new mexican cuisine .
the horror begins after you drive off the lot .
we all ate cereal at home it was so bad .
i told him that was ridiculous and i would just buy it on amazon .
again all the service was done promptly and for a very reasonable price .
this is a solid mexican food restaurant in old town scottsdale .
the bartenders are great they remember a face and always make me feel welcome .
one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time .
and the food was fantastic .
i left a _num_ % tip due to the piss poor service .
"however , customer service was awful ."
love is ... a full tummy of sushi .
very clean and staff continued to clean when we were there .
honest air live up to their name .
my problem with this place is the bartenders .
and they are honest .
neighbors are dirty and have no courtesy to your living !
amanda b is absolutely fabulous !
are you kidding me ?
"since my original review , i 've been to a few other shows here ."
the beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible .
they have an amazing happy hour and delicious drinks ... .
"loved their food , very tasty and filling ."
both were excellent .
she even remembered our names and our drinks .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
there were _num_ mushrooms when my order arrived .
i love this place !
i am exciting to try the rest of the menu .
"if you 're looking for a great salon , this is it ."

all this combines to make a great pizza .
walked in and noticed the outdated decor ... and the smell .
i am hooked !
this place has done it right !
everything that goes on it is sooo fresh !
the walls are that thin .
the food was over priced and not anything like mexican food .
what is supposed an exciting and fun time has become an utter nightmare .
"im one , ill admit ."
i was impressed .
i love this place !
"best , most painless facial wax i 've ever had !"
the beauty of his technique is that the new hem does not flip up .
blue adobe knows how to make some killer new mexican dishes .
seems like they just took a dirty rag and quickly wiped down .

"the staff is always helpful , friendly , and knowledgeable ."

the wings are great .
pat was so rude !

the cornbread is the best ever !
"i appreciate customer service , and this place lacks it tremendously ."
the food was delivered quickly and everything was just ok .
we returned a few nights later and enjoyed some dessert .
i also asked for a refill on my drink .
this is definitely not a place i would recommend .
this location is consistently poor with their service .
"it 's not the biggest , but it definitely has a great selection !"
maybe if they had more fans things like this would n't happen .
i have lived here since _num_ and this is my first time !
the hummus is delicious and their chicken never lacks in flavor .
i 'm always disappointed .

"um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet ."
"it was really good , the corn patty underneath was a great surprise ."

our server has absolutely been the best server we 've ever had !
this is our first time with amazing carpet and i could n't be happier .
they were great !
kids are welcome to be kids !
i mean its not excellent but pretty good overall .
i also love all their cookies and baked goods .
the areas used to get ready were small .
"these past _num_ times , i tell the lady my simple hair cut ."
it 's a great place .
especially i notice its really great when it first comes out of the oven .
i recommended that place .
i then realized that my whole mouth smelled of onion .
the food sucked ... .
i have always recommended this to all my friends and family .
it hit the spot and was cooked perfectly .
this place has very bad customer service !
a few colleagues and i enjoyed dinner here .
the shrimp enchilada 's are also great .
looks like a hole in the wall but it 's pretty good .
okay so im a tourist !
"she became slightly more pleasant , but the wait for everything was ridiculous ."
just got done having dinner with my wife .
it 's not like there are very many slides to begin with .
"later they call and cancel the reservation , no apology , nothing ."
the atmosphere and service were fine but the food was disappointing .
the margs were good .
the views from the cafe are gorgeous !
he 's very old school and honest and i like that in a doctor .

our waitress should know that my husband nor i ordered anything alcoholic !
"we plan to go back very soon , the restaurant is wonderful ."
it was a serious mess .

dr. diana is a very kind and understanding and helpful person .
"as stated previously by many others , this company has horrible customer service ."
the wax job was horrible .
"god help , i have no idea why ."
my recommendation is to go ... and keep going .
first the salad went to gross .
"the pastor is sincere , inspiring , and humble ."
these two women are professionals .
_num_ : the food was almost warm .
"first , it was extremely small ."
i was shocked on how good the pizza was .
this salon meets all my needs and wants .
most of the time it is n't super crowded .
super nice place and the waitress was on top of everything .
it was $ _num_ on $ _num_ bill .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
it 's clean and their daily specials menu is always unique and delicious .
"the patio is so relaxing , and beautiful !"
this place is pretty amazing .
customer service is a joke .
the sushi on the other hand is just meh !
the only thing good was fast service .
this is probably one of my top _num_ favorite restaurants .
the staff and docs are incredible .
service was very friendly and welcoming .
today i had a similar experience as joey .
i walked out not that excited .
they have excellent coffee and espresso drinks .
the rice was cold and crunchy and the beans were extremely salty .
waited more -- complained -- was offered a glass of wine .
shooting benches are a little close together .
"they also allow people in late , which is a big theater no no ."
waiting forever for a table but the place was half full .
pizza is always fantastic .
"moral of the story is , do n't forget your id ."
the place is also very reasonably priced .
it 's the best .
the staff is always friendly and welcoming from the front desk to the techs .
"let me tell you , every doughnut i had was fantastic !"
help was great .
the place is pretty but internet is horrible .
the wait staff is always friendly too !
the service was not awesome .
"second , they obviously do n't know how to run a will call line ."
the service and food were all fantastic !
the fish had no flavor at all as it had n't been seasoned .
"what 's to say , this place is a low class hangout ."
the wings were mediocre tasting and were very small in size .
"despite my complaining , i continue to go back , every week ... why ?"
looks like they have pre-made cooked pizza .
the staff is rude and far from helpful .
"if you just want the food , then this is the place ."
how sad that $ _num_ million dollars was wasted !
my husband went to get it and there was no one to help .
my sandwich was good .
i 'm definitely coming back again and again and again and again .
i had an amazing meatball sandwich and tried they 're homemade sandwich .
i had to come on here to recommend that people not visit this place .
its one of the best we have had anywhere in the world .
excellent burgers and brew !
"not too mention the service is good , friendly n quick ."
the decor is an old library mixed with a rundown dive bar .
i highly recommend mesa northeast animal hospital !
let someone else get hired that wants to work .
love my hair cuts from erica .
found a new favorite spot .
family run business explains the quality and consistency .
the food was really wonderful as well .
service is awful !
the bug juice is delicious !
intimate and elegant the way we wanted our night to be !
"the food remains terrific , especially the boneless buttermilk fried chicken ."
_num_ % the best there is when it comes to gyros .

my response was stuck on the east side parking lot .
"oh did , i mention i do n't eat pork our red meat ."
and tony is a great host .
i 'm a big fan .
i strongly recommend them .
there was not very much pepperoni .
i highly recommend them if you are looking for anything that they offer .
our waitress was friendly and service was good .
i left detailed messages and never received a return call .
i loved the salsa .
of course i 'm not going to with that attitude .
the view of camelback mountain from their patio is amazing .
also this location is staffed with professionals who know what they are doing .
these guys are great !
"besides that , it is always a good time here !"
this place is for seafood lovers .
only had grooming done at this hole in the wall dirty place .
"another man was also waiting , at the hot chicken dinners to go area ."
"unfortunately , asu is incredibly profit driven for a state school ."
bagels and cream cheese are both fantastic !
we also did old west pictures and that was fun !
huge disappointment and ended any return visit .
i tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced .
the food portions are enormous .
this location is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
then never came back to check on us .
grimaldi 's is definitely a solid option for pizza in the valley .
veal was mushy and the marinara was way too sweet .
this place is not worth the overpriced dollar they charge .
the marquee in tempe is a joke !
"oddly enough , they do n't match their own online prices ."
i ordered the shrimp scampi which was quite delightful .
it was so cool .
"our server was really helpful , and handled our table of _num_ well ."
i really liked this one .
we loved the food and the service .
it was delicious .
it looked awful .
the food was fantastic !
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
"thanks to fellow yelpers , i found this little gem ."
"everything was tasty , cooked to perfection , and amazing ."
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
the spaghetti was stuck together like it was sitting out for hours .
these guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed .
that 's $ _num_ each plus tax .
do n't come unless you have lots of time .
needless to say she did n't eat it .
ps : clientele is as pretentious as they say .
the pad thai and pad se ew are both good !
"the staff is always kind , helpful and very professional ."
and it was n't an inexpensive visit either .
we stopped recently for lunch and had an excellent pie .
this place has stood the test of time !
i love elmer 's .
they charged him $ _num_ for a crap bottle of wine .
the employees there are generally full of themselves and their sweet bikes as well .
"the pizza was hot , and flavorful ."
i went for spa week and loved this place !
"it was okay , not what i would expect from them ."
"yep , this was great pizza ."
"most businesses understand that without the customer , the business would n't exist ."
"recently , i finally took my family out to eat at this place ."
first visit and we were impressed .
"they give us awesome deals , so we always go back ."
i do n't tolerate any level of disrespect from any establishment .
"prices are average , the atmosphere is nice and homey ."
"anthony , our server , was great ."
"but if you 're a sports fan , the atmosphere is terrific ."
it carries a pretty good inventory .
the gals here are always smiling and upbeat !
i enjoyed the greek combo immensely !
i just returned it and asked for something else .
the staff here is very friendly and efficient .
chicken was chewy and did n't have much flavor .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
he 's funny too !
makes you feel all special and shiny inside .
people were friendly and atmosphere was great .
french dip is always on point .
this is the best seafood joint in town .
the sauce was runny & too many onions .
all the workers are so kind and helpful .
"it 's cheaper than four peaks , but in no way as good ."
i love everything about this place .
the more important crust disappointment was that it was very hard .
a little spicy but it was delicious !
"it was , in one word , a disaster ."
you get better quality from a traveling circus .
yet when i sign in to my yelp account it is indeed listed .
i hate this place so so much .
the rice and tomato soup was good too .
our waiter was awesome !
our kids enjoyed their blueberry bagel .
"so she brought a basket of french bread with cheese , on the house ."
thank you !
diana in the sales office was a delight to worth with !
wait times for food - not a friday or saturday - are ridiculously long .
everything from ny steak to stir fry is on offer from great servers !
spend your money somewhere where they actually care about their customers .
cleaned up everything afterwards .
they have great quick breakfasts you can order to go .
"i 've been here several times , both for pleasure and for business ."
it is a typical upscale american restaurant .
"we have found an honest , affordable , reliable a/c repair company ."
but sometimes it 's worth paying a premium for location .
this is a great big lots .
went for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it .
stopped in for lunch despite poor reviews .

"as an employee of a very professional restaurant , i was shocked ."
the steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy .

check out new asian kitchen they have much better food .
the spanish cuisine is very much americanized .
"overall , everything was good ."
the customer service was an absolute nightmare at this hotel .
i 'm a north indian and know the north indian food very well .
"generally , no one takes responsibility for issues like this ."
oh and you have to pay almost $ _num_ for chips and salsa .
"i felt like that was unfair , very , very unfair ."
they were dry and had almost no sauce .
"normally at italian restaurants the calamari is fried , but not here ."
they are small town and personal .
always fresh and have never had any problems .

i love coming to see her on tuesdays .
and the fettuccine alfredo is absolutely scrumptious !
we tried the pesto with chicken and loved it !
"so we go for the great food , the service and the tasty margaritas ."
everything i 've eaten is amazing !
it 's close to our house so that is a huge bonus .
it 's just a kid for crying out loud .
"i do n't care what you 're serving up in there , no thanks ."
however on this occasion i did n't make it past the front desk .
the menu is simple and so is the food .

a bit on the noisy side but the fresh food makes up for it .
the tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce .

i 'm very please with the service and work !
this is the second time i have eaten her and i am not impressed .
"i ordered mole ribs , and the were inedible ."
"wedge had wilted lettuce , tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor ."

i pretty much always get the prime rib .
"second , and more importantly , no one ever offered to help me ."
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
"as fresh as it gets , straight from the deli ."
he was rude and not explain well why he did not change .
i recommend going there .
"i got a chicken , carne asada and fish taco ."
he avoided my eyes and of course never approached our table !
let 's just say it was a complete disappointment when arrived .
atmosphere is a1 .
i would definitely recommend the dolly to all ages and it is inexpensive .
love thai food and this restaurant knows how to cook thai food .
a tortilla factory and you only make flour tortillas in one size ?
i thought he was kidding but he was actually annoyed that i wanted delivery .
this is about as authentic as you will find in the us .
a picture says it all .
apparently they are too busy to bother with a small job .
the burrito alone was over priced and it was quite small .
we will definitely stay here next time we 're in phoenix .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated at a time with plenty of open tables .
thank you for keeping us safe on the road !
the good it 's always good and the service is tops .

the italian food is generous if not too generous but very good .
kazimierz holds a special place in my heart .
"the staff is friendly , too ."
or they simply do n't care ?

what do you expect from an entirely baked work force .
totally not what i was looking for but at least from same family .
i got shrimp tacos .
"oh well , i still love it and go at least once a week !"
"anyway , i 'm just not sure i want to return ."
i did not hear from them for two hours .
the portions are large and the coffee is good .
this place has zero customer service .
the decor is mexican which gives it a more authentic feel .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .

i loved the atmosphere .

the walgreens i lived by before was so much better than this one .

definitely want to go back and explore more .
the facilities are great and you can truly make a day out of it .
the `` hoagie '' had disgusting processed ham on them .
the customer service was excellent .
"unfortunately , when i spend $ _num_ on sandwiches i expect something worth that ."
we have had a great experience here .
saving me money is a quick and easy way to win me over !
"food is good , is n't an issue ."
the sound is great .
would n't stay here again if it was the last place on earth .
the splash pad is a joke .
i do not recommend ever going to this subway .
this place is very over rated .
i had the traditional benedict very tasty with a side of bacon .
we went to dinner with another couple and really enjoyed the whole experience .
it was perfectly cooked with a great crust .
john the owner and rod are very friendly out are honest .
"the food , atmosphere and service are all top notch ."
we did n't like any of these dishes we tried .
we also ordered a red velvet and a vanilla bean cupcake .
i recently had a denver omelet that really hit the spot .
i am beyond disappointed .
meat was dry and the tortillas tasted as if they were several days old .
"the overwhelming taste was fried batter , not fish ."
i especially enjoyed the flautas and guacamole .
the woman was horribly dressed .
service was poor .
great spot if you like comedy acts .
"it was so delicious , & we ended up taking half home ."
their bc iced coffee is incredible and the eggs benedict is good .
the atmosphere was beautiful .
i always have a great time !
supporting live comedy is what we do !
the price was very reasonable .
absolutely loved it !
i highly recommend this outback steakhouse .
one of the best mexican joints i have ever been to !
"nordstrom has the best quality , brands , and pricing of products ."
it 's really obvious that msg is and everything .
that is not okay !
the sauce in the katsu was kinda of bland .
the food is amazing and the service is usually pretty good .
plus the prices were great !
there prices are great .
service was a little slow but it was worth it .
the meat is so flavorful and goes perfect with the spicy mustard .
all _num_ of us thought our entrees were terrible .
"i do n't know if we 'll be back , which is very sad ."
i ca n't get past how crowded and busy and this place is .
please avoid this place if you value your health .
this to me is not the way to run a business .
we waited almost two hours and left with no hair cut .
"not only was the food bad and overpriced , the service was terrible ."
i loved our waitress .
i love this place .
"nice hotel , better than i expected for the price ."
it is nothing that i would rave about .
i got french toast with sausage and eggs .
the meats were fantastic and hummus and baba were spot on .
this has not had a bite out of it either !
i highly recommend chandler eyecare .
finally just paid and left to get out of there .
this was a bad choice on my part .
produce is fresh and the variety is great .
every single person we spoke to on staff was absolutely incredible .
their strawberry pancakes are effing amazing !
there was a woman 's hair in the bathroom too when i checked in !
while unique it was not something that i would try again .
the batter is light and flavorful .
the food is great and the owners and staff are so friendly and accommodating !
they also bring you bread when seated .
the beer on tap is super cold !
"you have been warned , do n't do it !"
the school has decades of great reputation for a reason .
"and the sweet potato fries are lightly breaded , just right ."
i do recommend reservations !

he also kept me informed every step of the way .
"this meant they cut corners , and will not stand by their mistakes ."
i highly recommend them for car repairs .
"i like a little crunch , but come on , not the meat !"
came here for dinner with a large group of friends .
i dream about the tacos from this place !
even though they 're across the valley from me i 'll definitely be back !
that is how they get your email address .
i felt very comfortable and would recommend them to anyone !
"the food , first and foremost is fantastic and so unique ."
the guys at this pool store have been great .
the salads are also well done .
the whites are too sweet for me and the flavors are weird .
i hate iced tea without ice .
very pleased with the products i bought today !
this is a terrible policy for any store .
the people here are very nice but the corporate ethics are in the trash .
after ringing me up he explained how to use the medications .
she made our first experience so special and really went out of her way .
i 'm very happy and recommend to everyone looking for professional services .
their outdoor patio space was beautiful and quaint too .
the food was delicious and reminded me of home .
even the guacamole is amazing .
it 's small and not very inviting .
we got two cannolis and an order of baklava both were very good .
my wife insisted we try this place because she 's really into hot wings .
the disappointment came from the quality of food .
just not sure what jim had done .
i think thats about it for me and king gyro .
hands down one of the best burritos i 've ever had .
he is honest and has a remarkable degree of integrity .
the bartender did n't seem to care at all .
everyone from the staff to the members are so nice and always so welcoming !
i 'd recommend if you 're in the area for a quick lunch .
"wow , i am grateful ."
why make fajitas that need more tortillas than comes with ?
the type of view provided and the cheesy decor was almost embarrassing .
after _num_ months i lost my cool and they transferred me to the corporate .
the mashed potatoes were excellent and the asparagus was n't too bad either .
walked in and smell just about knocked us over .
"but if you ca n't , enjoy inside as it is great ."
"the vibe in here is very cool , and very entertaining ."
the service was great and the food was delicous .
"service was efficient and friendly , which i appreciated with the large group ."
so i am going back for a third time at getting my car back .
they gave me the run around for weeks .
this place is amazing !
"i had heard so many good things , but wow was i wrong ."
we were both pleasantly surprised .
the first time i went it was n't bad .
great historic place that looks like it has never changed since it opened .
we waited _num_ minutes after we finished our dinner to get our check .
"service was excellent , room was very comfortable ... ."
"about _num_ minutes later , i ask if they 've found anything ."

"outback has always had great steaks , great service for a decent price ."

the service is really great .
the patio here is almost as good as the food .
"superb service from steve , despite allergy needs for menu changes ."
i asked if they had any time to show me dresses .
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes .
this is extremely bad customer service !

zach is the best bus boy you will ever meet .
"we absolutely love this restaurant , best italian food in chandler ."
i guess new ownership does n't care about loyal customers !
my boyfriend loves this place and i do n't mind it either .
the food was very good and the margaritas were excellent !
they provide great service for much less than competitors .
he does not seem remotely interested in customer service .
the food is delicious .
it was like an asian spring roll with chunks of italian sausage inside !
the italian soda was amazing .
"the food is good , the appetizers are well priced during happy hour ."
"when i had trouble with an online order , they corrected it with ease ."
delicious chicken parm ... we mostly get it for take out .
if you pay attention to there sales you can get lots of good buys .
they were done ahead of schedule and did a great job .
neither of us liked it very much .
it was n't too crisp and not too chewy .
gina 's spaghetti was great tasting and came with garlic bread .
the service was amazing and the food was even better .
the care that is offered is great and the fees are fair .
enjoyed the roaring fork so much !
i found a dead fly in my salad coated in dressing .
it feels like the owners have given up .
"if it was busy , you could certainly never play pool ."
they are open until 8pm too which is nice .
so what 's wrong ?
everyone was really nice .
clearly their aggressive pricing comes with poor quality work .
his staff is also amazing and so helpful !
malee 's is all about the food and service !
this place was really great and we will definitely be back .

i have already recommended this place to people .
it truly is a different kind of place .
"additionally , the staff is very genuine and friendly ."

_num_ : my wife order was lost .
they also have a nice looking walk-in humidor with a huge selection of cigars .
ordered the rib tip appetizers with hot bbq sauce .
i had a bacon wrapped pork tenderloin that was delicious .
the staff is fantastic and on top of things .
this place was just ok.
went with the rave about the tamales and loved them !

i came here to visit friends and have dinner @ elements .
i am so done with this plumbing company .
john was extremely friendly and helpful .

all in all this place was a failure .
i highly recommend the salmon salad !
there was absolutely no room in their `` nail salon '' section .
this place is not clean and no one cares apparently .
the pizza is the best ... hands down !
this was the worst service i 've ever gotten anywhere - ever !
probably the best i 've had in scottsdale .
i also recommend the mole !
it 's a good place to go for a day .
"when i put the dress on , i knew it was the perfect dress ."
"and , rude counter help does n't help at all ... ."
they are seriously overpriced and painful to work with .
this place is also just so much fun to walk around in .
everything is made fresh .
they have consistent quality and a great tasting product !
it 's a shame .
i highly recommend them - they are the best at what they do .
i went here last week and had a really blah experience .
"she is a fantastic pediatrician - knowledgeable , warm , listens , etc ."
i recommend this bakery highly !
just hard to recommend when the sushi is so ridiculously small and overpriced .
i had such a terrible night after that happened .
"the bad : the food is n't impressive , especially for the cost ."
the receipt was put on the counter and the associate walked away .
the chicken dishes are particularly amazing .
its not his fault he works for a company like this i 'm sure .
a good thing about this place is that they will give u a table .
the food was just okay but the service was terrible .
best latin food i 've had in a long time .
but it was not great food either .
"definitely pricey , but everything we had was well prepared and very tasty ."

this is by the far the best bakery in phoenix !
it was a pinch of cheese in between two _num_ ' corn tortillas .

hearing the name dos gringos just makes me want to day drink .
"when you have room for dessert , their cannolis & mousse are solid choices ."
breakfast foods are great .
massage was worthless .
"i came to have my teeth worked on , not see a show ."
"the other time , i ordered bacon pancakes which were just ok ."
they offer one of the best happy hours around .
the spa is laid back and helpful .
brooke is the best i 've ever had with waxing .
they have the best take out for mexican food .
they 've got a great pizza .
ice cream is not worth that hassle .
i 'm definitely going back .
this place is disappointing and everybody who works there is useless .
"brought in a new claim , body shop was fantastic ."
very friendly atmosphere and the staff are courteous and helpful .
"they have amazing sandwiches , pizzas , salads , and deserts ."
"so , i get it ."
they are open until ten every evening and have the best staff .
surprisingly the line moved super fast .
i ordered a root beer float & it was a disaster .
"in conclusion , this place is overpriced with limited options ."
the salon is clean and the conversation is always easy and interesting !
the marquee sucks .
this place is horrible !

the prices were ridiculously high .
bottom line save your time and money just go straight to somewhere else .

love the cantonese chow mein and the festival shrimp is awesome !
one blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude .
jacob 's burro was not too bad .
this place is terrible !
one thing i noticed is also how bad the pizza looked !
"the escargot was delicious , and seasoned perfectly ."
starting back in _num_ when we were on a vacation here from chicago .
the food is very spicy and well prepared .
it was a little difficult to communicate my order .
i was able to make my selection easily .
i highly recommend this company to anyone in need !

this place is great .
good food but the staff is so disorganized it 's not worth the trouble .
"casual and quick , the salsa bar is great ."
we love both rings the same ... .

have started going back and it is still the best food and great price .
the chicken was n't dry .
the rack of lamb and halibut are cooked perfectly !

the children 's section in quite large and the staff is always helpful .
it totally lacked in antique merchandise and that was what i was there for .
"fast , friendly service should be expected , and they nailed it ."
we ordered the pulled pork tacos ( delicious ! )
"when he came back , hers was not frozen ."
"last time i went , i requested a fill in ."
"it 's very convenient to my home , but not at that cost ."
when it came we should have sent it back .
"it was my first time , but was not impressed ."
"sad , this used to be a staple in my family ."
the orange chicken and the sesame chicken tasted the same .

"the portions are perfect size , so much flavor , and very filling !"
my hair looks great .
these guys are top notch .
prices are great ( especially for lunch ) .
the portion of fish on the salad was the smallest i 've ever seen .
the crepes in the cannelloni were very rubbery and the filling lacked flavor .
the sandwiches are to delicious !
cute little place but the decor really needs updating .
"their patio is awesome , very soothing atmosphere with a nice waterfall ."

the costumer service is great .
they make some amazing food !
"we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure ."
this is a nice casual restaurant serving good food .
the food is average to less than average quality .

but it 's worth seeking out .
the few items i 've had on the menu are consistently good .
and the service was worse .
this food was amazing .
it 's refreshing to see all the good reviews .

"oh well , their patio was lovely ."
"super clean and well organized store , and it 's not all mystery !"

just took our new pup into palm glen and boy was i impressed !
this place was a splurge and a wonderful experience for us .
the halibut special that my mom had was also wonderful .

very disappointed when we received delivery .
this seems like a scam to me .
i did n't see or taste anything that would make me want to return .
it 's very dirty feeling and old looking in the inside .
the food is bursting with flavor and always great with presentation .
the bathroom setup is probably worth a trip if only to check it out .

i ordered shrimp fajitas and there were no tortillas included !
he tried to make it seem like we were being kicked out !
"they are known for having thin , smashed , juicy meat and tasty fries ."
"the sushi was drowning in eel sauce , all over my plate ."
they still write out your bill by hand .
"so , i pay with my credit card ."
it 's perfectly cooked and the juices just soak into the bun .

they are our personal first aid team and we are grateful they are here !
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
"she treats you great , does wonderful nails and makes you feel very welcome ."

if jade palace were to open in ny it would close in a week .
the portions are extremely generous with the little extras .
- in this case it was customer no service !
the chicken panang curry is amazing .
"if we lived here , we 'd be going here on a regular basis !"
so let me get on to the dish i had .
justin was a very attentive server .
first time in the city and this place has amazing kabobs .
"service was spot-on , and my panini was delicious ."
i agreed to use the lower level instead .
"the lamb kabob was delicious too , and it came out very fast !"
"the food was superb , the view was gorgeous and the service was phenomenal ."
nothing has changed in decades and i love it that way .
"`` yeah , but it 's only like _num_ % eel ."
it was so good .
staff is always super helpful and nice as well .
"do not go see this vet , what a horrible experience that was ."
loved it and will definitely return !
for some odd reason i ordered chicken parm .
eric is very courteous and professional .
kazimierz is a hidden gem in old town .
we enjoyed every bite .
this is amazing hummus and pita bread .
"having said that , the food is so good we come back anyway ."
they also have great appetizers and their pasta really yummy too !
food is always great here and probably the cleanest restaurant i 've ever seen .
their dessert calzone with nutella and bananas is fantastic .
the service was very friendly and great .
this is not what i expect when i buy my yearly membership .
it is good .
it is a hidden gem and our go-to sushi spot .
it 's plain condescending .
they enjoy the extra play times and getting a bath while they 're there .
the menu is eccentric and full of interesting things .
was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie .
the dessert was the best part for me .
the bartender said `` nothing . ''
this was a terrible experience !
had everything you needed to stay active while you 're away .
the environment was nice and quiet .
food is shockingly good for the place it is .
i also like the location in the scottsdale fashion square .
had a delightful late lunch on the patio .
and the chips and hot sauce is so good !
the hamburgers in the bar looked and smelled incredible .
i continue to be a huge fan !
the margaritas and tacos were delicious and full of flavor .
i really recommend this place if you like spicy food .
i love this place !
the pasta was bland and the meat sauce - also bland .
d 's is a wonderful mom and pop shop .
this place is great .
the office was able to get us in right away .
the other servers walked past us as if we were invisible .
the pork itself was n't my favorite but it was good .
it had a lot of good flavors going on and was cooked well .
you can see how i like my mongolian beef !
no one wants to pay $ _num_ for shitty sushi .
"anyway , there really is n't much to say about this place ."
salsa was ok but the eggs were awful how does this place stay open ?
she completely cleared up my skin and suggested some great products .
salads were pretty bad with just iceberg lettuce .
it was wonderful .
the sandwiches were nothing special .
the server was very professional and knowledgable .
oh one more thing this place hates cell phones .
and i never come to the er for pain i just deal with it .
prices are decent and location in old town scottsdale ca n't be beat .
the menus is good with decent prices .
everything we got was fresh and very good .
this is unacceptable .
i do not recommend this salon .
thank you thank you thank you !
"i felt so bad , i cooked up something for her at home ."
"and if there 's a line of cars , park and go inside ."
oh wow this place is awesome !
"chelsea , the store manager , has exceptional customer service skills ."
"if you go here , go luck ."
for me to drink my latte while i wait ? )
it was a great experience .
"if your car needs repair , this is definitely the place to go !"
this place is becoming one of the worst stores .
we also stayed there for the weekend .
lowes sucks !
"no apologies , just `` we do n't have that . ''"
i get it every day !
i highly recommend trying this place out .
i liked this place way better than other places in mesa .
he always manages to make it look brand new .
no let me guess what you have !
everyone was so kind !
the food has always been quite enjoyable and service is always on point .
i ordered a shredded beef burrito and it was excellent .
the variety on the menu is outstanding .
they have a good list of them too .
"well , most of it was healthy !"
tried their italian menu and really liked it .
"but there is neither , just excuses ."
this is clearly a place to see great musicians and artists .
they have good package deals if you want more .
i got them for a graduation party and they were a huge hit .
"i get to pick which test to do , no consultation !"
his response was that he did not have the authority to do that .
we had an amazing experience celebrating our anniversary .
"the naan was bland , and a little soggy ."
we recommend him without reservation .
"unfortunately , the staff was n't nearly as excited to see us ."
this place is a wonderful way to step back in time & treasure hunt .
i 've had better menudo at filibertos and i 'm mexican !
"the flavors were bland , even the on with jalapenos in it ."
they also have really good appetizers .
"i had the prime rib , which was cooked to a perfect medium rare ."
the sugar bowl is a scottsdale institution .
they did n't even have the right product from the beginning .
"the service was absolutely top-notch , and the facilities were exceptional ."
i find a salon without anyone answering the phones to be highly unprofessional .
"this place had a lot of cool stuff , inside and out !"
this is by far the most honest and best mechanic i have ever visited .
seriously - this place is too cool for itself .
give it a shot especially if you love italian food !
the staff are experienced and well informed .
i love this place .
"of course , i have a problem with it ."
_num_ workers who had zero sense of urgency .
it always gives you a ton of food !
the food is also top notch .
there are far too many other great restaurants for me to bother coming back .
"we went tonight because we got discounted tickets , _num_ for each ."
"sushi was fresh , flavorful and just right ."
"the staff is very friendly , helpful and professional ."
had fun two stepping here on a saturday night to an amazing band .
even the eggrolls were horrible .
we had dinner here tonight and it was just average .
i had tomatoes and really enjoyed their caprese salad .
we tried everything thing they had out and everything was really good .
six is a great alternative to the club scene .
sonny was a great mechanic !
i ordered a caesar with chicken .
he does not seem warm and friendly at all .
i ordered a side of red sauce to dip my pesto pizza in .
it looked like a fine blue collar place for pool / beer after work .
"it is rather expensive , but well worth it ."
"like i did , be prepared for disappointment ."
breakfast menu is terrible .
i 'm happy to say that i 've finally found it .
not sure why they are even in business .
chopped salads are simply amazing !
"the expiration date was september _num_ , _num_ ."
the whole process was pleasant .
lady cashier did n't give me my change .
the food itself is n't awful .
"ok , i get it ."
it 's off that the prices are n't posted on the menu .
tried them for the first time and i will be a regular .
got ta love the clearance racks as well !
the environment is very relaxed and calm .
service was top notch !
they just want what 's good for you .
i loved living there but moved to be closer to my job .
loved it .
mike and scott make me feel like family .
wifi is fast and reliable too .
mike the bartender is my favorite .
"but the reviews are correct , the drink prices are ridiculous ."
i had another fantastic experience at steven paul salon .
"the food was really good , including the salad bar ."
i always seem to have a great time at this place .
caused me to call and shop at target instead .
this goes for my boyfriend as well .
shannon was the best waitress ever !
the cheese plate was great .
the punch card is a great deal too .
nice folks run this place and it is always packed .
the last chinese restaurant that i loved closed .
pizza is always good .
had a wonderful waitress and food was amazing !
our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us a couple of times .
but this was not the venue for them .
they really do have super great burritos .
the prices were the best and worth it .
great atmosphere every time i 've gone .
this place is a shit hole the management is nonexistent after _num_ o'clock .
very sad to learn that as i loved the place .
the patio is awful !
for a mobile home park it is extremely clean and quiet .
"the staff is so friendly , knowledgeable , and helpful ."
oj and jeremy did a great job !
that is horrific customer service !
i do not recomend this store to any one .
"everything was great , no complaints , except for the service ."
"this is an italian restaurant , what could have taken an hour ?"
this room really felt like a super _num_ suite .
"i would have given _num_ stars , but my stomach hurts now ."
all in all it 's a great experience !
there are only so many places you can get great delivery food in scottsdale .
this place is a treasure in old town scottsdale !
there is a $ _num_ charge for sharing anything .
i really appreciated that .
she is also rude .
food was ok nothing special .
"pies are great , wings amazing ."
"by far , qt is the best convenience store in az !"
the exotic mushroom pan fry is just as good .
this restaurant is outstanding in every way !
my moms personal pizza ended up to be $ _num_ .
this is hands down a very good italian restaurant .
i love this place so much .
this is a rarity i have seen in other shops .
it was n't as good as i expected .
i got the chicken wings which were about $ _num_ and a beer .
he pours great drinks and seems like he actually cares about his patrons .
"even my parents , who had n't had persian food before , enjoyed it ."
he was not hurry up and get here today today today .
the orange chicken was good but the curry chicken was watery and bland .
no answer and it went to voice mail .
best dillard 's i have ever been to !
the colorist brittany is amazing !
their house band with friends was great .
i absolutely loved this store !
i always stop in for dinner when i 'm in scottsdale !
i feel blessed to have the mayo clinic right in our town .
we have never done that before and we eat out together once a week !
this place is _num_ square feet and it s always packed on the weekends .
they are very nice .
food is always very good .
they do n't really have variety of selections to choose from .
staff very accommodating and the meal was excellent .
love love love love this place !
they had n't even started the order yet .
some of the very best sushi i have ever had !
"on the way out , we met manager nick ."
i live right down the street .
the staff is super friendly and they know what they are doing !
but that 's just me ! )
"the desserts are always amazing , their cheesecake is my all time favorite ."
we ordered the chicken nachos and jalapeno sliders ... both were delicious .
but i 'm sure it 's great !
this scottsdale institution is epic in every way .
it 's not too big of a deal .
"lunches were average to above average , and dinner was above average ."
the comedians were good ( some were great ) overall .
not acceptable if you have the same standards i have .
it 's great ... .
_num_ thumbs down .
thumbs down !
"also , they lied about 24/7 security ."
"the restroom on my , it was scary ."
they lie to you about fees and then change them after you move in .
it makes me wonder how often the studio is cleaned down .
this place is so beautiful and welcoming !
the price is perfect for what you get !
he was very rude and i would never go back .
"manager apologized , did n't take plate away ."
"i looked at her and said `` ok , can i see it '' ?"
what if i change my mind ? ''
well ... thanks again fellow yelpers we loved this place .
the most amazing and helpful employees i have ever experienced at any store ever !
thank you roaring fork !
_num_ minutes later my order was finally given to me .
i had the carnitas and the pork just fell apart with an amazing flavor .
our other dinner guest ate only half his carne dish .
i loved my hair when i left and still do !
i highly recommend this salon !
it was huge and delicious .
it 's too bad because i do believe that their doctors are great .
"love , love , love this deli in my neighborhood ."
the food is amazing !
got to watch planes take off while eating - great for kids !
the food has been excellent though .
all of the staff was so nice and friendly .
our drinks took a while to get and one of them was forgotten twice .
worst dining experience ever i decided for first time to write a review .
if you are n't strong i do no recommend coming alone .
both jerry and natalie provide great service and chat .
at this time i got confused based on the initial quote they gave me .
the chairs are so comfortable and the china so fine .
my folks loved it too .
"really crowded when we went on a weeknight , but well worth it !"
the kids loved the live country band .
they kept the place cool and the service was very attentive .
the presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
found this place about _num_ years ago .
felt like i got way more than what i paid for !
"did n't need a refund , just replacement ."
i 've ordered the mashed potato bowl and it has been delicious !
i 'm pretty sure it only takes 5-10 minutes to fry some chicken .
glad we tried it and we 'll definitely be going back !
_num_ ) security to get in is a little bit of a pain .
so i walked in the _num_ heat to an atm and back .
they have live music and a nice selection of food too .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced at any car shop .
so i guess they are not roaches .
this place is top notch when it comes to fresh deli sandwiches !
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
first shop i checked out after moving to the phoenix area .
we were also very happy with the wine .
it was excellent and you can buy it to take out for $ _num_ .
i though this might be wrong and just checked myself .
"oh , and the food gave my friend the terrible runs ."
"he has a great , wide assortment of songs , old and new ."
"good eats , enjoy !"
she did not like it .
service food quality were all without complaint .
it 's a great place for dogs !
"pizza is loaded with toppings , great taste ."
the california roll was delicious with the big pieces of crab !
the grilled vegetable salad is one of the best salads in the valley .
gives your meal a great atmosphere .
this man is not a good doctor .
thank goodness i do n't live in phoenix .
the service was good as well .
"a great deal ( beware , bar is crowded . )"
they really care here .
their cocktails are delicious and ambiance is lively .
"would i stay here again , only if someone else was paying for it ."
"terrible , absolutely terrible ownership ; the lady has no regard for her customers ."
"the bread was very plain , even though one slice had olives in it ."
recently i have noticed the quality of the food has gone way down .
"i felt greasy after eating it , which was a shame ."
"i ended up with a gigantic , tasteless mess ."
"i walked in anyway , despite thinking i was in the wrong place ."
i never received any response which i think is pretty crap business .
the customer service is nonexistent !
the food was fantastic ... like always .
the asparagus and salmon was cooked to perfection a nice blend of flavors .
i have too many stories of poor service to even list here .
no flavor and they forgot the tomato sauce .
i definitely recommend anyone in scottsdale to check this place out .
stopped in for lunch and was surprised by how tasty everything was .
i love trader joe 's !
i have to say this restaurant is the best one in phoenix area .
the building is always clean and the staff is always friendly .
the challah bread french toast was unique .
the oranges are amazing !
they took the time to find the right battery and installed it for free .
"they are always fresh , chewy and delicious ."
i have been here for breakfast a few times and i love it !
do not waste your time and/or money at this car wash .
my husband and i went in for a _num_ buzz and a bang trim .
sashimi was outstanding .
i 'm not going back again .
"a good crowd was on hand , despite the dust storm warning ."
"the more i go here , the more i hate this venue ."
they also have wonderful customer service .
i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty .
thanks leslie - you 're the best !
"dig living here , quite and gated which is nice ."
oh yeah and service is pretty good too .
"little girls were crying , and their moms were desperate ."
i highly recommend this place .
it 's a very very small place you ca n't .

he came back a few minutes later with our drinks and a cold appetizer .
she too did n't like the egg rolls .
he had the pork tenderloin and thought that it was bland .
lance is very personable and takes good care of you .
"the desserts are great , they have a good wine selection and phenomenal service ."
that 's _num_ hours after doors opening .
"they were dressed nice , and we had been out to the pool ."
once you go there a few times you are like family .
i love this place !
why ca n't other bar establishments serve delicious food like this place does ?
and the staff did nothing to stop them .
"the pools are heated and huge , and the hotel restaurant has solid food ."
everyone in my group loved their food .
i love a good bar especially the food .
they promptly completed the services it did need and charged a fair price .
this is a great place for a big group or family .
prices are really reasonable .
we just had lunch the food was very good .
the are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great .
before we ate already starting with a bad taste in our mouths .
she yelled at my daughter saying only _num_ coupons per household .
i 'm _num_ % sure these guys just disconnected the .
this is right in my neighborhood .
"now that i live _num_ minutes away , not so often ."
"frankly , their food is n't tasty enough to warrant the risk ."
it 's too small and not very clean !
and freakin said hell no .
we sat on the patio too which was very pleasant .
"for what you get , it seems a little over priced ."
i had a carne asada tostada and rice and they were great .
this was our first time having someone outside the family cut his hair .
this is a must when we are in phx .
the fries were the only thing i ate .
the food is excellent and the ambiance is perfect for any date night .
i hate coming to this sally 's .
they remember me every time !
the tacos are quite good too !
the ambiance is just perfect .
the staff is always friendly and happy to help you with whatever you need .
it has always had an eclectic mix of items .
it is similar to the crust used at peter piper pizza from childhood .
i ordered the meat lovers and it was amazing !
the pastas were cold except the mac and cheese which was tolerable .
we had a great time .
highly recommend you give this place a try !
the spicy tuna did n't taste anywhere near fresh or right .
so happy we found this wonderful veterinarian office !
i liked them a lot .
i arrived _num_ minutes later .
prices are high & do not get much for the price .
happy hour is good .
just had some brake service done and once again a great experience .
i was treated with dignity and respect at all times .
i look forward to picking it up at the store on monday !
it was barely warmer .
best sushi i 've had on the west coast .
the best part is during happy hour you can get it for half price !
tatiana is amazing and well worth the hour drive !
"the manager richard makes you feel like home , taking care of little details ."
the sandwich was n't the greatest either .
the excuse for raw chicken was that they were `` in a hurry . ''
"when i think authentic mexican street tacos , tj 's is the spot !"
the sundae is excellent !
all the reviews about her are right on point !
"the food was ok to bad , and the staff was very rude ."
the store made me feel dirty and cheap .
this is where anything positive ends .
alex assisted her and he did an awesome job as well .
the staff has always been super nice and i have always been nice back .
the bar only had about _num_ customers including my self and my two friends .
loved it !
i signed the voucher for $ _num_ for _num_ tickets `` on sale '' .

kudos to angie and roberto who really are stand outs on a great team !
everything i 've had here has been really great .
they are just so pleasant .
their philly cheese steaks are also delicious !
best ribs i ever had .
julio g 's is a poster child for everything a restaurant should not be .
the food is great and the place is fun .
we loved it along with the guacamole dip .
the patio here is absolutely amazing .
"as _num_ year patrons , we are no longer supporting their establishment ."
the restaurant is clean .
every order came out as ordered and tasted amazing .
the menu and the service is amazing !
the total cost was $ _num_ before taxes .
it 's all good !
i was yelled at by the extremely rude person running the car wash !
that 's not how you treat customers .
they 're good to us .
best skate shop i 've ever visited !
our waitress was rude and she could barely be bothered to take out order .
heather h. has been my stylist for years !
it 's especially nice on evenings outside on the patio .
"i 'm hungry though , so i still dig in ."
the taste was so good .
"also , breakfast is free , drinks from 5:00 to 6:30 ."
the front desk crew is not very welcoming or very nice .
i was in town for only three days and i ate her twice .
i 've never been late ever until i lost my job .
i wish i could rate them negative stars .
"they definitely bring a lot of food for you , portions are huge !"
the bagels are fresh and the cream cheese is delicious .
i would definitely recommend blue adobe if you are in the scottsdale area .
everything we order has been great .
never acknowledged that we were there .
"service , overall , was spotty and a bit slow ."
i highly recommend them .
our order is always right we 've never had a problem !
i moved to mesa from northern california a year and a half ago .
"downfall , prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location ."
i received outstanding service and very fair pricing .
it was a great deal - $ _num_ for haircut and partial highlight .
the lighting is just sexy too .
she carefully explained her opinion and options .
do n't be fooled by this `` gourmet '' shit either .
i love you so much .
"if they were new waitresses , they 'd get a pass ."
the beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless .
the veggies were awful and strange .
my husband $ _num_ rib-eye steak was also extremely salty and terrible .
the prime rib sliders were excellent with the side of atomic horseradish .
the entire meal was mediocre at best !
the best brands that have great quality are found here !
to sum it up it was a sub par experience at least for me .
"oh sushi kee , how i love thee !"
my wife orders the cheese enchiladas and those are very good as well .
i loved my breakfast and the coffee was the best .
we split a few tiramisu for dessert and they were delicious .
the food was amazing .
i thank both of these men for their patience with me .
breakfast plates are all soo good !
"happy hour changes by day , but it 's everyday !"
this is exactly what ra is for sushi .
they did a great job !
i did n't even really know what to think .
they have that too !
"coffee is always fresh , donuts and bfast foods always plentiful and fresh ."
the service was great !
their salad bar is extensive and the food is fresh .
i enjoy coming here after hiking .
"completely awful service , although burnt the food was still good ."
"my patio faces the green , disgusting pool ."
piper was nowhere to be seen most of the time .
is be pleased to return .
the service is attentive and prompt .
drain in shower smells like back up sewage .
i do n't want an apology just attentive professional service .
i should 've known better .
they no longer bake their own bread .
"when and if it is busy , the waitresses are n't always attentive ."
the staff is always friendly and often hilarious !
this place is disgusting .
they waited _num_ hours and _num_ minutes to call us and tell us .
tasty food that 's consistent .
the rest of the staff has been great too .
the keg is our favorite restaurant .
she was so nice and so willing to help .
overall it was great service and great food .
when we asked her she said it was and just walked away .
i 'm an extremely picky eater and sensitive to textures in food .
the food was delivered after _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
i definitely got my money 's worth with this item .
"overall , the place was really bad ."
the wings were disgusting .
chilaquiles very good !
"they give the client confidence , and they make me look good ."
"definitely great food , good atmosphere , and our service was fine ."
family owned restaurants are delightful and this one is no exception !
my brother got one and it looked great .
almost all of the shows i have seen here have been extremely pedestrian .
"not only is she talented and experienced , she is friendly and personable ."
i 've eaten at this kona grill several times .
got hit with another $ _num_ bill .
they have the best chicken and dumplings and breakfast here is amazing .
paradise valley florist is fantastic !
i checked online and the only place it was playing was the cheap theater .
everything was tasty and rich and arrived promptly .
they do great work and are always honest .
he said he would have to grab the store manager to assist us .
"totally rude behavior , i guess they have too many customer ."
i would say it smelled of urine or a dirty bathroom .
"i was thoroughly disappointed by the entree , however ."
this is a wonderful restaurant .
ambiance is very mediocre and nothing special .
it was really awkward .
"also , my husband found the brake pads he needed at rei ."
i told him this was absolutely unacceptable and they had lost my business .
the noodle dish had some vegetables and pork .
took _num_ min for someone to get my water .
i 'm so glad this place is always consistently amazing !
$ _num_ means nothing .
finally another server asked me if i needed one .
"had the worst restaurant experience , ever , at this establishment ."
if you need a new pizza place to call home check this place out !
"i had the shepherd 's pie , and i sent it back ."
i 've lived here for a year with my boyfriend .
service today was terrible .
but there are so many flies in the restaurant it 's almost unbearable .
"it did n't make me sick , so i suppose that 's a positive ."
i hate it when it takes _num_ minutes to get a cup of coffee .
she refilled our water constantly and gave us just the right amount of attention .
the rice was hard and dry as well .
i think pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff .
the cake was delicious !
"if you like spicy and delicious thai , look no further !"
i 've eaten at the pita house on several occasions over the years .
i had a calzone which was yummy but the service ruined the experience .
ill review it next .

the drive-thru is very convenient .
i really enjoy the flannel style of hash .
"i 'm originally from scottsdale , and grew up dreaming of getting married here ."
best breakfast place i 've ever been to in all my life .
there are just two nail technicians out here .
the food was really good .
and it 's really good !
there are much better places for breakfast .
last time had pizza and wings and was really good .
went to pay for bear course and it was almost _num_ per person .
"if you are looking for good mexican food , do n't look here ."
i 'm also done with hotwire and their misleading bait and switch tactics .
this is the nicest place ever .
naan was fresh baked and delicious and was great mixed with saag paneer .
"my chicken marsala was alright , but still stingy , even with the sauce ."
"the food was not great , matter of fact it was a bit disappointing ."
"when i found this store years ago , i thought i was in heaven ."
"food was ok , service was bad ."
the employees are so friendly !
"it sucks , big time ."
"the fish is so fresh and mo is awesome , meticulous , and fun !"
i am on the vip member list and sometimes get offered free tickets .
she went in the back and returned with four cupcakes smashed into a napkin .
i love to volunteer here when i can .
"since nobody showed up in _num_ minutes , i decided to leave ."
the staff is friendly and the water is pure .
we loved it !
service was just decent .
they remember our names and our orders !
i enjoy coming here for lunch to get the slices .
we really enjoyed it .
my daughter was in tears and didnt even want to see the doctor .
i have never been so disgusted with a hotel .
this place is ridiculous .
the host returned and told us a _num_ hour wait .
this is a perfect spot for happy hour or a special meal .
nothing my date ordered was very appetizing .
i enjoyed my stay at the hotel .
their happy hour is exceptional .
this was probably the only really good thing about the meal .
i was very disappointed .
bosa is most definitely the best !
patio has a great atmosphere at night .
the chicken was burnt so badly .
haha blue adobe is amazing !
i 've had better and i 've had worse .
food is good and the wings in particular .
no one asked if we were there to dine .
this is `` new mexican '' style .
"when they charge you , front desk says only _num_ $ dollars ."
the tech did not seem experienced and pressed way too hard against my belly .
"my whole family comes here , and has been for years now ."
"drinks are fairly cheap , and service is very friendly ."
my wife had the fish tacos - very good !
ribs ... best i 've ever had .

of course the amazing scenery was awesome .
we liked the food here .
turns out they do not .
this is my second trip back .
"after a few bites , we threw the entire dinner away ."
service is super fast and friendly .
employee taking order was short and rude .
i had a great experience today at mark kia .
it was literally floating in grease .
the service was horrible .
"fun atmosphere with great outdoor people watching , what else do you need !"

"the beans are so light , fluffy , and flavorful ."
we probably get pizza from here once or twice a month .
it 's a great memory making day for the family !
"in addition to the master craftsmanship , the tailor was hilarious !"
even little cesar 's gives free crushed peppers .
my husband has been eating here for years and its a family favorite .
i called steven paul himself and left him a message to make him aware .
"horrible injera , it was not warm or fresh at all ."
they do n't even deserve _num_ star !
the sauce is great and the toppings are generous .
"great sports bar , they have pool tables & darts as well ."
"you ca n't beat the price , and they do deliver ."
now that 's worth it to me !
the decor is bland and depressing and has n't changed in years .
and here is the best part ... the service is awesome !
everyone is so friendly and attentive .
there goes my $ _num_ .
so my _num_ minute oil change turned into _num_ hours and a scam .
the manager comped our meal .
i got the top hat sundae .
they have amazing prosciutto .
"customer service is what is lacking though , hence the two stars ."
i wo n't even talk about how poorly the place is now laid out .
food is delicious and we always have so much fun .
"this place is disorganized , rude , and low quality ."
when i took them home they did n't seem right at all .
the bar food is really good !
the staff was exceptional .
he is an awesome salesman and defiantly deserves employee of the month !
i am not sure if the kitchen is in the same education .

"they have an amazing selection of organic fruits , and vegetables ."
i can not understand why there is no manager who can fix this .
i love this place !

my husband got my original engagement ring at this kay jewelers .
they are all very friendly .

great food and atmosphere and you have to try the cowboy salad .
whatever the girls were talking about was apparently more important than the customers .
wow do they have everything you need .
thank you very much !
i highly recommend this restaurant .
the mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like nothing ... .
"they are no dealership , but chris does his best to make you happy ."
"the food was shit , even the raspberry iced tea had no flavor ."
it seems to always be crowded .
however this time it was not the same .
"this time , i made a special trip to sugar bowl with the kids ."
she said sorry and walked away ... .
even worst was the texture - clams should be tender and not rubbery .
the food is disgusting .
malts burgers and hot dogs are great here .
"she was n't very friendly , not rude but inviting ."
the rice was also very dry .
the service is always on par .
the daily specials are always a hit and the food is always fresh .

the staff was great and helpful working really hard to keep things clean .
they are very professional and willing to work with your individual needs .
this place is a great place for traditional american breakfast !
is n't this supposed to be `` fast food '' ?
this was the definition of a great restaurant .
and told me to stop complaining or he would throw me out .
i had one dinner here a few months back and i enjoyed it .
the service here is awful !
service was slow and in attentive .
now me my husband and my son who is _num_ months are homeless .
"sure , i guess you ca n't remember or write it down ."
which is cool to the touch !
love that they have some games to play too .
i love the staff that make this place a warm and fun atmosphere .
it 's actually bigger than the san diego store .
there were about five tables taken and plenty of empty tables available .
i am completely turned off by their student services dept .
why do they just assume their time is more valuable than mine .
"stopped by to look , -- not impressed at all -- ."
all of the items were quite bland .
the staff here are very friendly and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming .
the reviews were _num_ out of _num_ .
kinda over priced but always taste good .
so i decided to visit this shit hole of a place aka the hospital .
i loved the pink parlor look .
"greasy , unappealing , low quality -- that 's your food ."
i told him i just wanted my money back .
she always goes out of her way to make sure we are happy .
lunch specials are amazing .
my mom had an egg salad sandwich and it was completely bland .
and the service is super fast !
although the owner was very friendly the lady giving me my mani/pedi was rude .
maintenance staff is rude and ca n't be bothered .
food was fantastic .
"their meals are interesting , unique and very delicious for the price ."
so i ordered _num_ honey bbq wings from this place .
that 's completely unacceptable .
they were also extremely fair in pricing .
i 've already recommended a friend to go here and with gina !
this is pretty good place to workout overall .
toppings were not very flavorful .
they have lost a good customer .
my teller was extremely nice helpful and patient .

my boyfriend loves it now .
"when we finally got our sushi , the rice and rolls just fell apart ."
you feel like you 've stepped into a different world .
the staff is wonderful and everything smells like pittsburgh willy 's !
the food was great .
figured i 'd try a chorizo and egg burrito .
on the bill she did change the charge to meatball ... .
this place was great !
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
place is pretty great .
he also argued with my _num_ year old neighbor about the entire situation !
our greeting was less than friendly .
place is outdated and needs some help .
i do n't like this place at all .
the techs are helpful as always .
either way the atmosphere was excellent and the food was good .
"the employees made me feel so welcome , it was the best ."
this `` new '' management is super unprofessional and rude to customers .
the inventory here sucks .
the staff is awesome and my nails & toes always look perfect !

the `` patrons '' were amusing and the bartender attentive .
i love this place !
"if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck ."
beer is a good deal as well .
good atmosphere tv 's everywhere for sports .
my expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood .
today they literally hung me out to dry .
showed up with a party of _num_ and they basically refused to seat us .
they made personalized conversation and seemed genuinely happy to help .
this is a great little bar in scottsdale .
"however , this was the worst massage i 've ever had ."
i usually choose pizza hut among other competitors but not after this experience .
the last stylist had this attitude like i was wasting here time .
"but , did n't want to start all over at another store ."
staff is great !
have been buying accessories and batteries for years .
i just felt that the calamari was bland .
however this time they got me on the radiator flush .
i love this place !

"the quesadilla was amazing , i wish i ordered _num_ more for my entree !"
great lettuce wraps and the bbq chicken flatbread was awesome !
the bacon was prepared perfectly as well .
"they have great weekly specials , including two nights where kids eat free ."
she knows the merchandise like no other .
my lemonade was not refilled the entire time .
"up until the last year , i rarely had a bad experience ."
looks are definitely deceiving with its bright orange paint on the outside .
employees ca n't get the order right and they ruined the tempe location .
i did n't even want to give them one star .
just so you know .
so i was unable to bring the chicken in to get my money back .
"the wine and drinks are above average , with an above average price tag ."
the cashiers are super slow at taking orders and getting food orders out .
"three years later , people still talk about the food at our wedding ."
and really is only $ _num_ cheaper than a taxi .
my waitress to her credit noticed it and the food was never set down .
there is no way we will be back .
one star but in reality they do n't even deserve one .
i love this place .
food was completely uninspired and pedestrian .
only thing that was `` okay '' was the paint job .
"well , at least the syrup is -- they make it with your order ."
the tacos and crab cake are my favorites .
the massages i got were amazing !
the food is delicious and savory each time .

"and by the looks of things , this place is a crowd pleaser !"
the bonus is the service .
fresh ingredients and cooked and prepared perfect .
this is a very compassionate lady that owns this store .
for a chain i really like this place .

it was fabulous !
thank you !
i tried this place twice before the remodel and the food was not good .
this is my favorite place to come and hang out with friends .
"after all that , she brought us _num_ glasses of very cold sangria ."
communication & customer service are obviously not something this company values ... at all .
food is good every time i have come here .
"for my bacon , all i tasted was salt !"
service was impeccable .
the owners are so nice that i like supporting their business .
"it 's a great office , very friendly staff , comfortable , and professional ."
it is a cute place off the path a little .
had an awesome experience here .
you guys are awesome !
"girlfriend ordered the kung pao , was also spicy and good ."
organic food that 's good for you for affordable prices ?
you need to empty your pockets too .
and it 's not even a large bottle .
wine selection is outstanding .
the golf course is beautiful and near the base of camelback mountain .
my cousin and i walked in about 10am on a weekday .
they have the best pizza and wings .
if you want quality and personal service this is it !
i 'm very disappointed in the quality of the food served here .
it 's a very special place for my family .
"it is the new asu head coach , you know . ''"
great place to get top of the line meat and it 's fresh .
"it 's fairly casual , but charming at the same time ."
the turkey had absolutely no taste at all .
the clientele looks like a bunch of average joes .
i love ra .
instead lee morgan handled literally everything and did so professionally and timely .
you really have to see it to appreciate it .
i dive into my lunch and something is off .
"there are a lot of available units , there is a reason for that ."
all the techs are great that we 've encountered .
tip : 3rd floor is the best .
this restaurant is amazing .
this is the best place in the valley for nails .
the crab cakes and skewers are also excellent .
my partner and i both enjoyed the dinner .
the staff was friendly and attentive .
"exceeded my expectations , the perfect bouquet for our perfect new baby girl !"
she knows a lot about games which is something i was not expecting .
we were seated immediately .
the views here are breathtaking and even the range and practice areas are perfect .
had to pay an additional $ _num_ .
_num_ stars - that 's it .
understaffed leads to horrible service on a busy weekend morning .
"the set up was very awkward , no ambience ."
"sadly we never have room for dessert , but i hear its amazing !"
jennifer and the staff are great !
"seriously , i want my money back ."
the food is great and always consistent .
this is highly recommended .

i am definitely a fan .
the servers were nowhere to be seen .
instead we received dishes that ranged from ok to awful .
the staff at his office were fun and pleasant .
this place was super disgusting before the remodel so we avoided .
the facility is clean and welcoming .
this place is excellent new mexican cuisine !
we love zipps !
upon arrival i was told _num_ minutes for a party of two .
service was excellent !
"the atmosphere was so-so , they should have had music on or something !"
first of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit .
also you 've got to try the pot stickers !
the patio is amazing and they have the best margarita 's in town .
food is great usually especially the burritos .
it sucks .
we sat down and ordered cheesy garlic bread to start .
"regardless , speedy excellent service , and have never had a bad experience !"
it 's just horribly ran .
i highly recommend misty !
i strongly recommend them to anyone in the valley .
i had the hot dog and my wife had a grilled cheese .
and now i will tell you what added insult to injury .
i added more in two months and it lasted another _num_ !
most of the channels said no signal .
seriously dont waste your money .
the food is always amazing .
"it being around _num_ or 6pm , the place was utterly packed ."
one rep told me i needed to visit a branch to figure it out .
the sprint employee next door began looking for the radio shack employee .
"as soon as we finished dessert , our water glasses and napkins were removed ."
i just loved this place !
she clearly paid attention to detail and did a wonderful job on my nails .
we did top off dinner with some really good pistachio type ice cream .
i do n't understand why people still go here .
there could have been more meat but it was still good .
he really knows his stuff .
i 've yet to try their food but the ice cream is delicious .
my co-worker got a sandwich and a breakfast shake .
"however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would ."
"i love it , i love it , i love it !"
this place is the worst .
that garbage at least has better consistency and taste .
see someone that actually cares .
all were excellent .
liked the decor as well .
this place brings my taste buds home every time i eat there .
service was great food was even better .
i bought a car and the service and experience was great !
the staff was somewhat obnoxious .
thank you for a fabulous evening !
the atmosphere is amazing .
if they do cancel they do not leave voicemail to cover their end .
the price is always perfect !
everything is so fresh & good .
"also , he has one nurse practitioner who i can not stand !"
"they have tasty ribs , sliders and pasta dishes to name a few ."
also make sure you start off with the clam chowder !
worth a check if you 're in the market for some gently used items .
he then explained a _num_ cent cd would cost me $ _num_ .
if you love sports then your going to love this place .
5pm - 7pm is happy hour .
no diamonds were missing .
the delicious little rolls and muffins started this meal off right !
"unfortunately , the food was terrible ."
this itself was very grimy and difficult to read .
no thank you no acknowledgement of my business no nothing .
"the atmosphere is light , airy and welcoming ."
food is amazing !
this place is awesome !
loved that eating outside was n't too loud with the traffic .
horrible doesnt begin to describe it .
it will be just as good as it was in the restaurant .
i highly recommend this veterinary office .
if you like thai this is a must !
he did n't ask why we were sending it back .
"i had lunch at lon 's and wow , what a great experience ."
so this was a delightful touch .
all other parties at the table were disappointed as well .
"the pita bread was not fresh at all , way too chewy ."
"i 'm sorry , but that 's unacceptable ."
"we both had the ribs and i must admit , they were very good ."
"once they get you in the door , they forget about you ."
when the guy came to the door he said it was $ _num_ .
the worst facial ever and it was _num_ minutes long .
"original , i guess , is one way to put it ."
now it 's a major money drain .
very friendly and knew all the best dishes .
my custard bun was pretty lackluster .
"as a parent , my joy was watching my kids have fun ."
1st pot of coffee i got was cold .
it 's good solid food .
service is top notch .
the flavors are fantastic !
their happy hour is amazing .
it was a shame because we were really looking forward to dining there .
came with hubby for a romantic weekend getaway and had a great time .
got us in same day !
i ca n't remember the last time i had pizza and disliked my meal .
we ordered food and were both very happy .
everything about it was lousy .
to boot ; all information including the contact info is on the front .
second ... service ... very capable guy who knew the menu and always smiling .
"chicken tacos had bland chicken and came on crunchy shells , which was unexpected ."
we went in with a groupon for lunch as a first time customer .
"had a nice atmosphere , quick service , great steaks , and prime rib ."
_num_ thumbs up !
one had a sewer smell .
love love this place !
we count on joe 's for some of the best pizza in town .
first of all there is no table service .
this place is just cute good old fashioned fun !

then recently lost _num_ shirts and _num_ dress pants when dry cleaning .
but was better .
expensive but offers great challenge .
it is what it is .
the rice to fish ratio was totally off .
probably the worst breakfast that i have ever had - both food and atmosphere .

"chicken was dry , beans were flavorless , as was the rice ."
so i wandered around looking for someone or for what to do .
he did n't let me play and check either time after he finished .

it 's definitely not worth $ _num_ .

a very dear friend of mine worked here for ... almost a year ?
highly recommend this fast drive-thru !

we were wrong .
"after an hour , i was told that our room still was n't ready !"
i took a date there late on a saturday night - it was perfect !
produce looked like trash .
"owner is great too always helpful , always smiling ."
i found this place when i moved to phoenix _num_ years ago .
everyone is very nice and professional .
brought my girls here this summer for one week of camp .
does anyone know how to answer the phone there ?

she did n't know how to do an even coat .

dropped in to quality bumper a dealership recommendation for some running boards .
the food seemed like leftovers from lunch .
the food is excellent and kinda unique for the area .
we have never been denied access to a restaurant before .
i wish i could give a good review but i really ca n't .
both of those are so rich with flavors and amazing over rice .
the salad was fresh a crunchy !
one room packed so tight you could not move .
interior design is very dated and in need of a complete deep cleaning .

his staff office are helpful and very nice .

"god , that was a mistake ."
we had appetizers and entrees and they were so great .
it really hurt .
the water pressure in the shower was horrible and the water was extremely hot .

salad was drowned in dressing .
"great view and the bartender christian is awesome , very friendly and helpful ."
the vet was very friendly as well as the support staff .

pours me a cup of super extreme coffee and says have a seat .
and it 's so close to home !
the bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty .
the green chili pork is fucking amazing !
but the service sucks .
i would highly recommend you find another doctor and practice for your pediatric needs .
food came quickly and was delicious .
my favorite is the peanut curry .
prices are amazing and the selection is incredible !
also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting .
place is not just outdated but falling apart .
other than that i have tried this pizza sober and it is disgusting .
one star is honestly a stretch for this place .
we were both very happy with the food and service .
they 're just not extremely kind or knowledgeable .
i 'm sure it will be a meal that you never forget !
the selection here is awesome .
i promise you a great time !
"the service is horrible , the food is average and the prices are outrageous ."
the coffee is amazing .
he helped remove many stains that i thought would never come clean !
it 's horrible .
i hate the parking .
_num_ seconds later they start telling him they 'll get more from the back .
i felt rushed even though it was empty on a saturday night .
and that does not make much of a standard to meet .
had a great stylist who was very thoughtful and their service was fantastic !
the doctors are very nice and the staff knows there stuff .
they did an exceptional job !
but their inventory was questionable !
sometimes you just need a good ol ' sandwich .
we also ordered mild wings .
the parking is terrible .
all the food is amazing and everything is all you can eat .
this place was outstanding .
"they were friendly , so that was a plus ."
dillard 's ... it 's my go to store !
this is the spot for a good time !
my dad 's salad was just as disappointing .
"the tortilla was fresh and hot , killer ."
it is just sad to see such a waste of prime real estate !
did not enjoy living here .
all is takes is the right tailoring .
i was horribly disappointed by my landscaping job .
absolutely would not recommend this clinic if you care for your animals .
we played the golf course and it was immaculate .
i would recommend them to anyone and have continued to do so .
i highly recommend this place !

i recommend .
he was rude and did not deserve our service .
i normally get the chimis with their poblano sauce ; so good .
they care about my family and always hope for our well being .
i took one bite and refused to eat any more of it .
i also had the mac and cheese flavor just dance in my mouth .
my family and i love this resturant .
do n't get your keys made here - they never work .
she tells me it will be $ _num_ .
"interesting , as jack told me it had been done _num_ days before ."
the sales people here are terrible .
he was so rude and condescending .
"the drinks are cheap , though ."
he 's terrific .
the lasagna is amazing .
t-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu !
i guess customer service is alive and well at this store .
it 's still my favorite sushi in scottsdale .
"i am extremely pleased with the results , and also with the service ."
dr. marks stuff is exceptional .
"however , it seemed impossible for him to show me my rental space ."
the staff is very friendly and thorough .
the staff was beyond wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable about the courses and wine selections .
they do all the things on their menu well .
i recommend this practice anyone looking for a great pediatrician .
so i was very thankful !
the christmas decor this place puts up is awesome .
i had a carne asada burro and the others had chicken and beef enchiladas .
the salad was about average but the chips were amazingly tasty .
be patient when it 's bird season ... it gets crazy !
there was wall covering splitting and much of it looked dated and warn .
i 'm glad this place is in my new home town .
we just moved here from out of state .
the menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls .
"the waitstaff could have been a little friendlier , but i loved it !"
"by the time the tortillas arrived , my food was cold ."
the bar is open from 6am until 2am and the prices are great .
the seating area is crowded with furniture that obviously does n't suit the space .
this business is really a hidden gem .
"from what we hear , this place is usually very busy ."
it just became mush .
the wine list continues to amaze me every time i go in .
ashley wright is a fantastic hairstylist !
actually everything we have tried there is amazing !
probably not the most amazing first experience i 've had at a restaurant .
hope to see you soon !

there is no single serving size for dinner !
our entire meal was so delicious .
the pizza here is just not very good .
the setting of this place is pretty cool because you are under ground .
we found it on a recommendation of the waiter at tortilla factory .
this is my favorite burrito place in south scottsdale .

i especially love it after a night out .
i 've eaten here twice and just honestly not a fan .
too bad there 's really no late night spots in the valley .
the soup was too salty and heavy and the panang chicken was kinda blend .
it 's clear that these ladies love their jobs .
i enjoyed sitting outside .
it is not worth to splurge over $ _num_ per night to stay here .
wife and daughter enjoyed it thoroughly just as much as i did .
and after a few bites i realized the dough was still raw .
"i love that it 's student work , fresh and modern and really intriguing ."

jim is extremely knowledgable and a pleasure to deal with .
"that being said , it was only 1pm and it was lunch time ."

i wish yelp would have a spot for no stars .

every day she answers and gives whatever excuse she can think of .
i do n't get it .

friendly knowledgeable staff always willing to answer questions when you go in .
i especially recommend the bread pudding .
i totally love cowboy ciao .
it just was n't anything i was super amazed about .

it 's tuned to the soul .
the bruschetta bread was soggy .
his staff is friendly and always willing to help .

salmon has a wonderful maple butter on top with a pistachio crust .
i 'm not saying this veterinarian office is n't good .
it 's small enough to be relaxing for the parents .
if they make a mistake you pay for it .

the other servers were checking on there tables constantly .
the tzatziki sauce did n't taste right .
this place was awful !

it is worth the _num_ minute drive !
this place is phenomenal .
went here on a whim and i regret i did .

they tend to short scoop so you feel like you 're getting ripped off .
"the atmosphere is great , especially on a warm night ."
have always been pleased .
"it was so bad and expensive , and i was so upset ."
i 'm mean it was so bad i could n't eat it .

the huevos con masa were fantastic !
it was definitely crowded so we were lucky to find two seats together .
i highly doubt i will ever be back to this weird ass place !
i was not very impressed .
"i did fail to mention , the rolls were good ."

they have saved my television each time and for a very reasonable price .
he is so professional and honest .
"this is a wine bar , no excuses ."
"nathan , nick and the team at this location are great to work with !"
i am also from california and am always looking for good tart yogurt .
this is a great place to shop for a new bike .
best tasting cake i have ever had from a bakery !

"with so many other sushi choices , it 's not a destination of choice ."
tasty but overpriced at $ _num_ for two breasts imo .
i really hate feeling cheated .
this place rocks .

i am disappointed .
"the food , normally good for baja , was lousy ."
"easy to make friends , staff , every one was really nice to me ."
i am definitely impressed !
"got the green chile pork , was outstanding ."
the flavor is somehow bold and bland at the same time .
"great rice , hummus was very good and great bread ."
everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not .
but overall i was impressed with charleston 's and will probably be back .
everyone was saying how great it was and they were right .
i just gave up .
the staff is also incredibly friendly and kind to my pets .
"ugh , this place is just terrible ."
this restaurant is way over priced for the quality of food presented .
the grounds are well maintained .
thankfully i had ordered a baked potato and it was great too !
this chef is as creative and focused on flavor as any in the state .
these people break the law and do n't care .
the eggplant parm is very tasty .
i love filiberto 's .
bww has by far the best boneless wings ever .
i think the potatoes may have been boiled a few days before .
this is my new favourite spot for authentic sushi .
since it was a business outing we were kind of stuck .
i definitely recommend it !
we had some small plates just to test the waters at this place .
bandera is just a great standard and they always do well .
it made it difficult to maintain the flow of our conversation .

totally takes the stress out of car issues !
the food is okay but there drive thru is hell !
i recommend them to everyone .

so i do appreciate the effort of the remodel .
room _num_ a/c does n't work too well .
charles came to my rescue .
we also got a bottle of yellow tail merlot @ ~ $ _num_ .

food was amazing ... and i 'm super picky about my italian .
"the food is served in a timely manner , as are your initial drinks ."
the amenities dr. wright provides for his patients make visits fun .
this place is great .

our experience here was superb from the ordering process to eating .

yes it does get worse .
the biscuits and gravy were good .
the hot sauce is just not good .
the dude who took my delivery order was really rude .
"they charge you to take out cash , and give you less cash !"
the hotel itself gets zero stars .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
"the dresses were clean , large selections and fantastic customer service ."
"hey , mistakes happen ."
the best thing i ate was the fortune cookie ... .
i work close and go for lunch often .
this dillard 's location is very nice .
good size food but the location is what makes it great .
she is as kind as she is professional ... you wo n't be disappointed !
they are a tad on the expensive side but i will always come back .
we were very disappointed .
priceline listed this as a _num_ star resort in scottsdale .
it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in .
"worth a visit , they also do a good job on takeout orders ."
aaron was excellent and any problem that came up was excellent .
i recommend the gnocchi gorgonzola but everything is amazing here .
it 's like going out on an expensive blind date .
my drink was n't bad .
"ok ... not better than sex , but the cake was very good ."
i can highly recommend their guacamole which is seasoned perfectly and never overwhelming .
the food is hot and tasty !
the staff were fantastic and really attentive .
he let me in my storage and he just walked away .
"the homemade tortillas were good , not amazing ."
they are very dishonest .
this is a strong bible directed church .
they are always friendly and great to talk to .
"atmosphere is cool , sushi was great , and had a great server ."
each one was better than the other .
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
that was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried .
everything we 've had here has been good !
that 's where the positives stop .
i appreciate men with integrity .
unfortunately there was not really anything else i could get excited about .
i do not recommend this bar and will definitely not be going back myself .
there are many more options in that area to spend my time and money .

my problem was with the facilities .
this time i knew better !
the staff was very courteous and the views spectacular !
these people were very friendly and very helpful .
"three words it sucked , sucked , sucked !"
six of us went to dinner on saturday evening to celebrate a birthday .
"i do not recommend macayo 's in any way , shape or form ."

built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
there was too much sauce and not much cheese .
i 'm thai so i definitely know my thai food dishes .
and they got great prices !
food is sooooo good !
"other than this , the pizza is like the original ."
their happy hour pricing is the best in the area !
this clinic is the best !
they are amazing .
this place made my stomach flip !
shortly after placing the order we were informed that there was no chicken .
food is quite pricey ( no surprise here ) .
"they clean the establishment really well , too ."
the captain was nice and cindy of course was great .
"i 'm unable to get my packages because of their hours , as well ."
